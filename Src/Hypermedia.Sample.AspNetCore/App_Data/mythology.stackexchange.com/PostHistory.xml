According to Wikipedia:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Among the first generation of twelve Titans, the females were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mnemosyne, Tethys, Theia, Phoebe, Rhea, and Themis and the males were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Oceanus, Hyperion, Coeus, Cronus, Crius, and Iapetus.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The second generation of Titans consisted of Hyperion's children&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Helios, Selene, and Eos; Coeus' children Lelantos, Leto, and Asteria;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Iapetus' sons Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius; Oceanus'&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daughter Metis; and Crius' sons Astraeus, Pallas, and Perses.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What you call Gods would be the **Olympians**, who later overthrew the Titans, some of whom were their own parents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Twelve Olympians are the major deities of the Greek pantheon,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; commonly considered to be Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Demeter, Athena,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Apollo, Artemis, Ares, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, Hermes and either&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hestia, or Dionysus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then, there are a whole host of minor deities, who fall under the &quot;Olympian&quot; umbrella.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a family tree denoting the differences between the three classes of deity [here][1].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, they are all deities, but different generations of deities. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/1f/5d/c1/1f5dc1857de2d527c25bdbfe87099df2.jpg" />

For example, Sekhmet, goddess of ferocious war, was sometimes shown with the head a lioness, as lions are ferocious creatures. Similarly Anubis was shown with a jackal head because the jackal was associated with the necropolis and Anubis was a god of the dead. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are also theriomorphic depictions, where gods are shown entirely in animal form.  These are quite common, and in fact were the most common representations of gods in the very earliest periods of Egyptian history. For example, Anubis as a black jackal, or Thoth as either an ibis or a white baboon. Taweret was even a hybrid of hippo, crocodile and lioness. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is the same reasoning behind why Christians equate Jesus with the lion, or why we give angels wings. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

He wrote, in Latin, of a sword called Caliburnus, whcih was made on the isle of Avalon. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chretien de Troyes wrote (again in the 12th Century), of a sword called Escalibor or Excalibor. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robert de Boron (late 12th/early 13th Century) wrote of the Sword in the Stone, and the idea of only the &quot;one true king&quot; being able to retrieve the sword. It isn't confirmed that this sword is Excalibur, but later versions took this story and called the sword Excalibur.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later, in the *[Post-Vulgate Cycle*][1] (13th Century), French writers attempted to bring together some of the scenes and characters of the legends (Wiki calls it a &quot;rehandling of the earlier Vulgate Cycle&quot;). In this version, the sword is called Excalibur, and is given to Arthur by the Lady of the Lake.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In *Le Morte d'Arthur*, by Thomas Malory, he gives both versions, and calls both Excalibur. Arthur receives the sword three different times in Le Morte, in three different ways (the stone, the lake and once in a battle). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, according to the 15th Century Alliterative Morte d'Arthur, there is a sword called Clarent, a fragile sword designed for ceremonial purposes rather than fighting. The internet (though I haven't found an original source for this) associates this with being the Sword in the Stone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In conclusion, there isn't a clear answer. The stories evolved quite a bit, and the sword that some writers took to be Excalibur was taken by others to mean Clarent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it does seem that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Excalibur and Caliburn ***do*** seem to be the same sword. It is a linguistic evolution. Both are taken to be Arthur's &quot;main&quot; sword, regardless of writer or name.&#xD;&#xA; - The Sword in the Stone, and the one from the Lake, may or may not be the same sword.&#xD;&#xA; - Clarent is ***not*** Excalibur, and is a different sword, wielded by King Arthur at points (and later, Mordred). It ***may*** be the Sword in the Stone, but ***is not*** the sword from the Lady in the Lake.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Vulgate_Cycle" />

He wrote, in Latin, of a sword called **Caliburnus**, whcih was made on the isle of Avalon. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wace wrote *[Roman de Brut][2]* (12th Century), which is described as &quot;an Old French translation and versification of [Monmouth]&quot;. According to Wiki, the sword is called  Calabrum, Callibourc, Chalabrun, and Calabrun (with alternate spellings such as Chalabrum, Calibore, Callibor, Caliborne, Calliborc, and Escaliborc).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chretien de Troyes wrote, in *[Perceval][3]*, (again in the 12th Century), of a sword called **Escalibor** or **Excalibor**. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Robert de Boron (late 12th/early 13th Century), in *[Merlin][4]*, wrote of the **Sword in the Stone**, and the idea of only the &quot;one true king&quot; being able to retrieve the sword. It isn't confirmed that this sword is Excalibur, but later versions took this story and called the sword Excalibur.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later, in the *[Post-Vulgate Cycle*][5] (13th Century), French writers attempted to bring together some of the scenes and characters of the legends (Wiki calls it a &quot;rehandling of the earlier Vulgate Cycle&quot;). In this version, the sword is called **Excalibur**, and is given to Arthur by the **Lady of the Lake**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In *[Le Morte d'Arthur][6]*, by Thomas Malory, he gives both versions, and calls both **Excalibur**. Arthur receives the sword three different times in *Le Morte*, in three different ways (the stone, the lake and once in a battle). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, according to the 15th Century *[Alliterative Morte Arthur][7]*, there is a sword called **Clarent**, a fragile sword designed for ceremonial purposes rather than fighting. The internet (though I haven't found an original source for this yet) associates this with being the **Sword in the Stone**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In conclusion, there isn't a clear answer. The stories evolved quite a bit, and the sword that some writers took to be Excalibur was taken by others to mean Clarent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it does seem that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Excalibur and Caliburn ***do*** seem to be the same sword. It is a linguistic evolution. Both are taken to be Arthur's &quot;main&quot; sword, regardless of writer or name.&#xD;&#xA; - The Sword in the Stone, and the one from the Lake, may or may not be the same sword.&#xD;&#xA; - Clarent is ***not*** Excalibur, and is a different sword, wielded by King Arthur at points (and later, Mordred). It ***may*** be the Sword in the Stone, but ***is not*** the sword from the Lady in the Lake.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historia_Regum_Britanniae&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_de_Brut&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceval,_the_Story_of_the_Grail&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merlin#Later_adaptations_of_the_legend&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-Vulgate_Cycle&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alliterative_Morte_Arthure" />

Pittheus understood the prophecy and introduced Aegeus to his daughter, Aethra, when Aegeus was drunk.

As with so much in the dreamscape of Romance, it is presented but not explained. Rather than being a token or a parable, the burning tree is a monstrum – a sign or a prodigy – that suggests that the protective boundary between the internal and the external worlds is in temporary abeyance. Such wonders serve to emphasise the apprehension that the final phase or end-game of the magical plot is close at hand. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't remember where I read this, but I've also heard a more subtle interpretation of the burning tree: because the tree is both burning (supernatural) and living (the &quot;real world&quot;), it symbolizes the connection between the two worlds. This fits with the other image that accompanies the burning tree:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And on one side of the river he saw a flock of white sheep, and on the other a flock of black sheep.

In return the Brownie was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; entitled to a bowl of the best cream and new baked cake or bread, to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; be put within his reach. **To offer the Brownie any form of payment&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other than this, especially to take pity and to give him new clothes,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; was an insult, and he would vanish immediately.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the entry for Tomtar:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Tomtar are the Little People in the folklore of Sweden.... They enjoy&#xD;&#xA;&gt; a bowl of porridge, and some bread and tobacco, but only on Christmas&#xD;&#xA;&gt; morning. To give the Tomtar any better gift during the year would be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sure to offend him, and he would do no more work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In essence, then, your theory is correct - it is a warning not to spoil your servants. However, I'm not sure that this is because it will &quot;go to their heads&quot;. My impression is that brownies, and similar beings, want to work on their own terms. To turn it into a payment, or transaction, was highly insulting to them, particularly if they wanted to do the jobs they want because they enjoyed it, or liked the family. To take pity on them, implying that they are lesser beings relegated to housework, causes offence, and this is the reason they leave - not that their newfound power has gone to their heads. Beings such as Tomtar and Brownies, then, seem to like ***appreciation***, but not ***payment***." />

They have also those songs of theirs, by the recital of which (“baritus,” they call it), they rouse their courage, while from the note they augur the result of the approaching conflict. For, as their line shouts, they inspire or feel alarm. It is not so much an articulate sound, as a general cry of valour. They aim chiefly at a harsh note and a confused roar, putting their shields to their mouth, so that, by reverberation, it may swell into a fuller and deeper sound. Ulysses, too, is believed by some, in his long legendary wanderings, to have found his way into this ocean, and, having visited German soil, to have founded and named the town of Asciburgium, which stands on the bank of the Rhine, and is to this day inhabited. They even say that an altar dedicated to Ulysses, with the addition of the name of his father, Laertes, was formerly discovered on this same spot, and that certain monuments and tombs, with Greek inscriptions, still exist on the borders of Germany and Rhætia.

Their counterparts could be found in various Indo-European mythologies, including the Germanic [Týr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BDr), the Baltic [Dievas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dievas), and the Vedic [Dyaus Pita](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyaus_Pita).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus, Greek and Roman mythologies exhibit great similarities due to them being cousins.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Syncretism**&#xD;&#xA;--------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, from the earliest period of the Republic, Roman religious belief had [adopted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism) Greek elements. **This begun extremely early, and far predates the Roman conquest of Greece.** One example is [Apollo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo#Roman_Apollo), who was directly adopted into the Roman pantheon. [A temple for him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apollo_Sosianus) was erected in Rome as early as 431 BC, long before the [Romans conquered Greece in 141 BC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_(146_BC)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way in which Greek beliefs were transmitted to the early Romans was via the [Etruscans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization). After their conquest by the Roman Republic, elements from the Etruscan belief system were integrated into classical Roman culture. In this way, the Etruscans bequeathed notable Greek influence on their own mythology to the Romans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, the Etruscan [Menrva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menrva) passed on influences from the Greek [Athena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena) to the Roman [Minerva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva). Another example is [](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)), who inherited traits of the Greek [Hermes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes) from the Etruscan [Turms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turms). Both long predates the Roman mastery of Greece; Mercury had a temple on [Aventine]() as early as 495 BC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not accurate to say that Rome inherited Greek religions because she had &quot;little mythology&quot; when she conquered Greece, although Greek culture did went on to be highly influential on Rome (&quot;*Captive Greece captured her rude conqueror*&quot;)." />

[Hugh G. Evelyn-White's translation of _Works and Days_ (from ellopos.net)](http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/greek-texts/ancient-greece/hesiod/works-days.asp?pg=4) describes them as&#xD;&#xA;&gt;(ll. 109-120) First of all the deathless gods who dwell on Olympus made a golden race of mortal men who lived in the time of Cronos when he was reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in flocks and loved by the blessed gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They were loved _by_ the gods, but nothing is mentioned about man worshipping or serving the gods.&#xD;&#xA;It seems it was Zeus who first demanded that of the Silver man (same source):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;(ll. 121-139) [...] But when they were full grown and were come to the full measure of their prime, they lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness, for they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another, nor would they serve the immortals, nor sacrifice on the holy altars of the blessed ones as it is right for men to do wherever they dwell. Then Zeus the son of Cronos was angry and put them away, because they would not give honour to the blessed gods who live on Olympus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And then on it goes to the Bronze and finally the Iron age. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At least according to Hesiod it seems the Titans didn't need worhip, at least from the Golden man. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for real people worshipping Titans, I can't think of a culture that worshipped Titans exclusively, but Cronos had a temple at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens, so at least one Titan was worshipped by real people, as [cosmovision](http://www.cosmovisions.com/$Cronos.htm) states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cronos ne figure guère que dans les mythes théogoniques; pourtant il avait un temple à Athènes au pied de l'Acropole.  &#xD;&#xA;_Cronos hardly played a part in mythology except in theogenic myths; and yet, he had a temple in Athens at the foot of the Acropolis._&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And of course there is the temple of Saturn in Rome ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Saturn)) and the Roman Saturnalia ([Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturnalia)), as well as the day after Friday. Saturn is usually seen as the Roman association of Cronos, so at least that one Titan did get worshipped quite a lot by real people, although, admittedly, it seems never to exclude the Olympians." />

Roman poets placed them on an island called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the &quot;flowery&quot; island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;When the Sirens were given a parentage they were considered the daughters of the river god Achelous, fathered upon Terpsichore, Melpomene, Sterope, or Chthon (the Earth; in Euripides' Helen 167, Helen in her anguish calls upon &quot;Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth&quot;). Although they lured mariners, for the Greeks the Sirens in their &quot;meadow starred with flowers&quot; were not sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Their number is variously reported as between two and five. In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens as two. Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Sirens of Greek mythology are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as fully aquatic and mermaid-like; the facts that in Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Portuguese the word for mermaid is respectively Sirena, Sirene, Sirena, Syrena, Sirena and Sereia, and that in biology the Sirenia comprise an order of fully aquatic mammals that includes the dugong and manatee, add to the visual confusion, so that Sirens are even represented as mermaids. However, &quot;the sirens, though they sing to mariners, are not sea-maidens,&quot; Harrison had cautioned; &quot;they dwell on an island in a flowery meadow.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Generally speaking the chief deity of Chinese traditional beliefs is a personification of the sky; this character however evolved through the centuries as Chinese religious beliefs developed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strictly speaking **the [`haotian shang-ti (昊天上帝)`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shangdi) is the supreme deity of *traditional* Chinese religions.** He is attested to in the earliest Chinese writings as `ti` or [`tian`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tian), and thus dates to the earliest period in Chinese civilisation. This is also the belief maintained in [Confucianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucianism). His name is usually abbreviated to just `shang-ti`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In contrast, **the [Jade Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Emperor) is the ruler of heaven in the [*Taoist* tradition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism)**. He emerged much later in the [late Han Dynasty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_dynasty#Eastern_Han), as a Taoist interpretation of the traditional `shang-ti` and personification of [Polaris](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polaris). However, while the Judaeo-Christian narrative identifies his position as supreme, this is not precisely true in Taoism. Instead, in Taoist hierarchy the Jade Emperor is in fact second to the [Three Purities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Pure_Ones). By definition, therefore, he is **not supreme**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The jurisdiction of the Jade Emperor closely resembles that of the temporal bureaucracy. Superimposed on him are the Three Pure Ones, represented by the triumvirate of the Celestial-honourd Primordial, the Supreme Old sovereign (Laotzu) and a third god, which are simple plagiarisms of the Buddhist trikaya.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Crotty, Robert B., ed. *The Charles Strong Lectures: 1972-1984.* Brill Archive, 1987.&lt;/sub&gt;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For some period during the same dynasty, the Pole Star was worshiped (by imperial decree) as the supreme deity [`tai-yi (太乙)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiyi), eclipsing `shang-ti`.

Perhaps the confusion is on the phrasing.  Genesis 4:16-17 doesn't say that Cain *met* his wife in the land of Nod.  Here is the King James Version of those verses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.  And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The phrase &quot;knew his wife&quot; is a construction used repeatedly in the King James translation.  &quot;knew&quot; here doesn't mean &quot;met&quot;, it means &quot;had sex with&quot;.  Later translations usually make this a bit more clear to the modern ear, using phrases like &quot;made love to&quot;, instead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I understand it (and I'm not a scholar of Hebrew), לדעת has many meanings, including both having knowledge of, and having sexual congress with (possibly euphemistically).

And to the best of my knowledge there isn't any real debate of the correct interpretation of this passage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More discussion of this usage can be found on English Language &amp; Usage:  [Why did Old Testament scholars choose to employ “to know” in a sexual sense?](http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/20107/why-did-old-testament-scholars-choose-to-employ-to-know-in-a-sexual-sense)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is nothing that precludes Cain having already been married to one of his sisters at the time that he left for Nod, and that he brought her with him." />

Depicting the lure of the sea as a desirable woman works as a great narrative device.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the Sirens have a supernatural origin, and their power is supernatural. Their seductive magic is in their voice, so they don't have to be beautiful - or Odysseus would have required his men to not only stuff their ears, but also wear blindfolds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When depicting Sirens, it makes sense to depict them as beautiful women to make it more immediately clear to the audience that they are temptresses.

[Mjölnir][1] is depicted in Norse mythology as one of the most fearsome weapons, capable of leveling mountains. In his account of Norse mythology, Snorri Sturluson relates how the hammer was made by the dwarven brothers [Sindri][3] and [Brokkr][4], and how its characteristically short handle was due to a mishap during its manufacture.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As to how it's made it is said on the wiki that it was made as a bet to show Loki that they could make a item more beautiful than those of the Sons of Ivaldi. Although they didn't intend to make the handle as short as it is. the reason for that is that Loki did not intend to let them win and therefor tried to hinder them during forging. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Finally, Sindri puts some iron in the forge and tells Brokkr not to stop pumping the bellows. Loki comes a third time and this time bites Brokkr on the eyelid even harder. The bite is so deep that it draws blood. The blood runs into Brokkr's eyes and forces him stop working the bellows just long enough to wipe his eyes. This time, when Sindri returns, he takes Mjöllnir out of the forge. The handle is shorter than Sindri had planned and so the hammer can only be wielded with one hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as to how [Thor][2] got [Mjölnir][1] if my memory isn't wrong then it was because [Mjölnir][1] was given to [Odin][5] as a gift. When [Odin][5] found out that [Mjölnir][1] deemed [Thor][2] worthy to wield him [Odin][5] gave [Mjölnir][1] to [Thor][2].

There is a Buddhist text, the [Milinda Panha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milinda_Panha), which is philosophical discussions between King Meander and a Buddhist monk Nagasena. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, ultimately, because of the self identification as distinct religions / traditions, *there appears to be little **narrative** crossover in this period*, as much as there were cultural crossover recognized in things like currency (see the Meander article again), art, and [morality, e.g.](http://www.academia.edu/5974580/When_the_Greeks_Converted_the_Buddha_Asymmetrical_Transfers_of_Knowledge_in_Indo-Greek_Cultures):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In order to propagate rules based on morality, equality and righteousness (Pāli dhamma; Skt. dharma), he employed several official languages and scripts derived from Aramaic, namely Brāhmī and Kharoṣṭhī, and also used Greek and Aramaic in public inscriptions carved on polished rock or stone. His pragmatism was likely to have been inspired by the Buddhists  who propagated their teachings in the languages spoken in different regions. In what may have been the earliest of these inscriptions issued in 258 B.C.E. Aśoka declares himself to have been a lay Buddhist disciple for more than two and a half years, and by the eighth year of his reign he publicly expresses remorse for the massacre in Kaliṇga and denounces the taking of lives." />

They may be either good or bad, and there is no clear demarcation between types of jinn as either strictly good or strictly evil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The could appear as pure spiritual beings, as stand ins for angels or demons, as indicated by Ibn Manẓūr, in &quot;Lisān al-ʿArab&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The people of the Jahiliyyah called angels-peace be upon them-jinn because they were invisible from sight&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They could also be tangible creatures, particularly with animal-like characteristics, as stated by &quot;The Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...were not pure spirits, for they were often represented as hairy and often as having the form of an ostrich or a snake.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Four specific types of Jinn are detailed as significant in the pre-islamic world:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Ghūl - Quoting Al-Jāḥiẓ &quot;Every supernatural creature that takes diverse forms&quot;.  They seem to appear in many different forms, often animalistic, and can appear and disappear &quot;like the light of a torch&quot;.  They (and generally any jinn, it appears) leave a physical corpse behind when killed, thus the poem by Ta'abbata Sharran:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I spent the night leaning on her, waiting for the morning to see what I caught.  Then I found two eyes in an ugly head, similar to the head of a cat with a forked tongue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Si'lah - The difference between this and the former is not clear to me.  They seem to be more sneaky and clever.  A story exists of a one marrying and bearing human children.  Possible other differences may be that they are active during the day, instead of at night, or that the Se'lah is female, and the Ghūl male.  neither seems to be universally respected though.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Shiqq - A man with only half of a body, and will beat a human to death if encountered.  Again, from Al-Jāḥiẓ:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There, a shiqq appeared to him.  He had only one hand, one eye, one leg.  They recited poetry to each other, then they hit each other, and both of them fell dead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Shaytān - They are noted for being smart, cunning and powerful.  And generally rebellious.  May or may not be a loan word from Hebrew, but still not necessarily evil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - ʻIfrīt, Qutrub and Mārid - Not well-known in pre-islamic time." />

Hercules Magusanus is a god with a double name, a Roman and an indigenous one respectively, and we should regard him as a syncretism of the Roman Hercules with Magusanus, a local deity or hero.

In particular, kitsune are strongly related to the *kami* [Inari][6], whereas huli jing are not strongly associated with any god in particular. From Wikipedia:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Japanese folklorist Kiyoshi Nozaki argues that the Japanese regarded kitsune positively as early as the 4th century A.D.; the only things imported from China or Korea were the kitsune's negative attributes. He states that, according to a 16th-century book of records called the Nihon Ryakki, foxes and human beings lived close together in ancient Japan, and he contends that indigenous legends about the creatures arose as a result. Inari scholar Karen Smyers notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the connection of the fox myths to Buddhism were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How much support is there for their separate origins?

[A temple for him](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_of_Apollo_Sosianus) was erected in Rome as early as 431 BC, long before the [Romans conquered Greece in 141 BC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Corinth_(146_BC)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One way in which Greek beliefs were transmitted to the early Romans was via the [Etruscans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etruscan_civilization). After their conquest by the Roman Republic, elements from the Etruscan belief system were integrated into classical Roman culture. In this way, the Etruscans bequeathed notable Greek influence on their own mythology to the Romans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For instance, the Etruscan [Menrva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menrva) passed on influences from the Greek [Athena](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena) to the Roman [Minerva](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva). Another example is [Mercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_(mythology)), who inherited traits of the Greek [Hermes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes) from the Etruscan [Turms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turms). Both long predates the Roman mastery of Greece; Mercury had a temple on [Aventine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aventine_Hill) as early as 495 BC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is not accurate to say that Rome inherited Greek religions because she had &quot;little mythology&quot; when she conquered Greece, although Greek culture did went on to be highly influential on Rome (&quot;*Captive Greece captured her rude conqueror*&quot;)." />

When Jason and the Argonauts approached Crete, Medea, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sorceress, occupied Talos by talking to him and using spells,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; persuading him to remove the nails from his ankles. Thus the liquid&#xD;&#xA;&gt; metal spilled out and Talos died.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So you could say that Talos bled to death. He was constucted out of metal and the blood in his veins was also liquid metal. Without it Talos died.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/talos-crete-00157" />

This *kind of* qualifies as a cult of Hercules perhaps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Significant here is the epigraphic evidence for the cult of Hercules Magusanus. Hercules Magusanus is a god with a double name, a Roman and an indigenous one respectively, and we should regard him as a syncretism of the Roman Hercules with Magusanus, a local deity or hero. The cult was based in Germania Inferior, particularly the Batavian region, as attested to by the distribution of votive inscriptions and the presence of some monumental sanctuaries that can be ascribed to this deity.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Roymans, Nico. *Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire*. Vol. 10. Amsterdam University Press, 2004. &lt;/sub&gt;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are enough attestations for the worship of this god, especially in the area of modern Netherlands, that he is thought to be the chief deity of the [Batavians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batavi_%28Germanic_tribe%29).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hercules Magusanus, who was probably the chief deity of the Batavians. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Nicolay, Johan.

But be ready to keep your ship here beyond the cast of his stones, till he yield the victory to me.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;(ll. 1659-1672) Thus she spake; and they drew the ship out of range, resting on their oars, waiting to see what plan unlooked for she would bring to pass; and she, holding the fold of her purple robe over her cheeks on each side, mounted on the deck; and Aeson's son took her hand in his and guided her way along the thwarts. And with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-spirits, devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who, hovering through all the air, swoop down on the living. Kneeling in supplication, thrice she called on them with songs, and thrice with prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief, with her hostile glance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and her teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth baneful phantoms in the frenzy of her rage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 1673-1693) Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my mind, seeing that dire destruction meets us not from disease and wounds alone, but lo! even from afar, may be, it tortures us! So Talos, for all his frame of bronze, yielded the victory to the might of Medea the sorceress. And as he was heaving massy rocks to stay them from reaching the haven, he grazed his ankle on a pointed crag; and the ichor gushed forth like melted lead; and not long thereafter did he stand towering on the jutting cliff. But even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which woodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they returned from the forest—at first it shivers in the wind by night, then at last snaps at the stump and crashes down; so Talos for a while stood on his tireless feet, swaying to and fro, when at last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud. For that night there in Crete the heroes lay; then, just as dawn was growing bright, they built a shrine to Minoan Athena, and drew water and went aboard, so that first of all they might by rowing pass beyond Salmone's height.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Argonautica, by Apollonius Rhodius](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;" />

There have been instances where Poseidon is jealous about Zeus' position as the King of gods. However, the same instance is said to be inspired by a conflict of interests, as Poseidon was not satisfied with Zeus' rule. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Poseidon took once part in a minor conspiracy in heaven; for he, along with Hera and Athena, had agreed to put Zeus in bonds. However, he was saved by Briareus (one of the HECATONCHEIRES), whom Achilles' mother Thetis had called to Zeus' rescue; and by just squatting down close to him and through the mere display of his force, Briareus frightened Poseidon and the goddesses away.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, his views towards Zeus was not always filled with jealousy. There have been times when Poseidon helped Zeus with his troubles and also fought beside him.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;He allied himself with Zeus in the battles against the Giants and repeatedly helped Zeus’s lovers. For example, he calmed the sea so Zeus, disguised as a bull, could cross it with Europa. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking into the case more deeply, Poseidon was not overly jealous of his younger brother and had a sense of respect towards him.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In Book Eight, Hera comes to Poseidon and asks him to join forces with her against Zeus, who is aiding the Trojans. His response displays the way in which his attitudes can change quickly. &quot;But the Earth-Shaker growled at her in anger: 'Hera, mistress of babble that you are, what empty-headed talk is this? I would not dream of pitting all the rest of us against Lord Zeus. He overmasters all'&quot; (188). Poseidon had recently attempted to dethrone Zeus on his own, but now became angered at Hera for even mentioning the idea. He switches his opinion again soon after this, however. In Book Thirteen, he chooses to disregard Zeus' orders to stay out of the combat and intervenes on behalf of the Achaeans. &quot;Rancor within him deepened against Zeus… from the deep water, girdler of earth and shaker of earth, Poseidon came to arouse new spirit in the Argives&quot; (300). He went from conspiring against Zeus, to anger at the mere mention of opposing Zeus, and back to opposing Zeus himself. Poseidon's attitudes towards Zeus here are not solid. Instead, they shift and sway, much like water does." />

The romans were never godless or religious-less but they borrowed and merged many of the Greek and Etruscan Gods into their own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example the cult of Sun was introduced in Rome after Aurelian's (around 260) successful campaigns in Syria.

There have been instances where Poseidon is jealous about Zeus' position as the King of gods. However, the same instance is said to be inspired by a conflict of interests, as Poseidon was not satisfied with Zeus' rule. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Poseidon took once part in a minor conspiracy in heaven; for he, along with Hera and Athena, had agreed to put Zeus in bonds. However, he was saved by Briareus (one of the HECATONCHEIRES), whom Achilles' mother Thetis had called to Zeus' rescue; and by just squatting down close to him and through the mere display of his force, Briareus frightened Poseidon and the goddesses away.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, his views towards Zeus was not always filled with jealousy. There have been times when Poseidon helped Zeus with his troubles and also fought beside him.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;He allied himself with Zeus in the battles against the Giants and repeatedly helped Zeus’s lovers. For example, he calmed the sea so Zeus, disguised as a bull, could cross it with Europa. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking into the case more deeply, Poseidon was not overly jealous of his younger brother and had a sense of respect towards him.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In Book Eight, Hera comes to Poseidon and asks him to join forces with her against Zeus, who is aiding the Trojans. His response displays the way in which his attitudes can change quickly. &quot;But the Earth-Shaker growled at her in anger: 'Hera, mistress of babble that you are, what empty-headed talk is this? I would not dream of pitting all the rest of us against Lord Zeus. He overmasters all'&quot; (188). Poseidon had recently attempted to dethrone Zeus on his own, but now became angered at Hera for even mentioning the idea. He switches his opinion again soon after this, however. In Book Thirteen, he chooses to disregard Zeus' orders to stay out of the combat and intervenes on behalf of the Achaeans. &quot;Rancor within him deepened against Zeus… from the deep water, girdler of earth and shaker of earth, Poseidon came to arouse new spirit in the Argives&quot; (300). He went from conspiring against Zeus, to anger at the mere mention of opposing Zeus, and back to opposing Zeus himself. **Poseidon's attitudes towards Zeus here are not solid. Instead, they shift and sway, much like water does**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;sources: [1](http://www.igreekmythology.com/poseidon.html#L1),[2](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7x9EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=poseidon+conspired+against+Zeus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VpWgrhJiWv&amp;sig=-6szBPKYyTd1m6C2kVmVKobAinI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7fpBVf32DsHYmAWPzYHgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=poseidon%20conspired%20against%20Zeus&amp;f=false),[3](http://robertjamesreese.com/essays/a-history-of-poseidon),[4](http://www.maicar.com/GML/Poseidon.html)&lt;/sub&gt;" />

In many of these stories, Zeus assumes a form other than his true self. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most famous is perhaps Leda - it is said that Zeus seduced her in the form of a swan (some versions specify that he came to her, in swan form, seeking protection from an eagle).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there are many other stories - [this page][1] lists several lovers who were not seduced in human form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ANTIOPE: A Lady of Thebes in Boiotia (Central Greece) who was seduced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by Zeus in the shape of a **satyr**. She bore him twin sons Amphion and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Zethos which were exposed at birth.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; DANAE: A Princess of Argos (in Central Greece) who was imprisoned by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her father in a bronze tower. Zeus seduced her in the form of **a golden&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shower**, and she gave birth to a son, the hero Perseus.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; EURYMEDOUSA: A Princess of Phthiotis (in Northern Greece) who was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; seduced by Zeus in the form of **an ant**. Their son was named Myrmidon&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (Ant-Man).&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; LEDA: A Queen of Lakedaimonia (in Southern Greece) who was seduced by&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Zeus in the form of **a swan**. She laid an egg from which were hatched the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dioskouroi twins&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; PHTHIA: A girl from Aegion in Akhaia (southern Greece). Zeus seduced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her in the guise of **a pigeon or dove**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some stories, it makes complete sense why Zeus assumed the form he did:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ALKMENE: A Lady of Thebes in Boiotia (Central Greece) who was seduced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by Zeus in **the form of her own husband**. She bore twins: Herakles&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by Zeus and Likymnios by her husband Amphitryon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The story of Semele, Dionysus' mother, explains why Zeus does not present himself in his godly form - mortals perish when they look upon gods. However, it doesn't really explain why Zeus chose such varied, non-human, and frankly weird (ant?!), shapes for his seduction process.

However Homer gives no reason for his punishment, no list of crimes and so we must look to other Classical writers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The myth featuring Sisyphus and Thanatos comes from a fragment by Aeschylus titled *[Sisyphus the Stone-Roller][1]*:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sisyphus bound Death fast, so that men ceased to die, until Ares came to the rescue, released Death, and gave Sisyphus into his power. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apollodorus, *Library* writes of one of his apparently many duplicities:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  This punishment he endures for the sake of Aegina, daughter of Asopus; for when Zeus had secretly carried her off, Sisyphus is said to have betrayed the secret to Asopus, who was looking for her. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hyginus in his *[Fabulae][2]* gives the following reason :&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sisyphus and Salmoneus, sons of Aeolus, hated each other.

There have been instances where Poseidon is jealous about Zeus' position as the King of gods. However, the same instance is said to be inspired by a conflict of interests, as Poseidon was not satisfied with Zeus' rule. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Poseidon took once part in a minor conspiracy in heaven; for he, along with Hera and Athena, had agreed to put Zeus in bonds. However, he was saved by Briareus (one of the HECATONCHEIRES), whom Achilles' mother Thetis had called to Zeus' rescue; and by just squatting down close to him and through the mere display of his force, Briareus frightened Poseidon and the goddesses away.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Source: http://www.igreekmythology.com/poseidon.html#L1&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, his views towards Zeus was not always filled with jealousy. There have been times when Poseidon helped Zeus with his troubles and also fought beside him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He allied himself with Zeus in the battles against the Giants and repeatedly helped Zeus’s lovers. For example, he calmed the sea so Zeus, disguised as a bull, could cross it with Europa. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Source: [Mythology 101: From Gods and Goddesses to Monsters and Mortals, Your Guide to Ancient Mythology](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7x9EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=poseidon+conspired+against+Zeus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VpWgrhJiWv&amp;sig=-6szBPKYyTd1m6C2kVmVKobAinI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7fpBVf32DsHYmAWPzYHgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=poseidon%20conspired%20against%20Zeus&amp;f=false)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking into the case more deeply, Poseidon was not overly jealous of his younger brother and had a sense of respect towards him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In Book Eight, Hera comes to Poseidon and asks him to join forces with her against Zeus, who is aiding the Trojans. His response displays the way in which his attitudes can change quickly. &quot;But the Earth-Shaker growled at her in anger: 'Hera, mistress of babble that you are, what empty-headed talk is this? I would not dream of pitting all the rest of us against Lord Zeus. He overmasters all'&quot; (188). Poseidon had recently attempted to dethrone Zeus on his own, but now became angered at Hera for even mentioning the idea. He switches his opinion again soon after this, however. In Book Thirteen, he chooses to disregard Zeus' orders to stay out of the combat and intervenes on behalf of the Achaeans. &quot;Rancor within him deepened against Zeus… from the deep water, girdler of earth and shaker of earth, Poseidon came to arouse new spirit in the Argives&quot; (300). He went from conspiring against Zeus, to anger at the mere mention of opposing Zeus, and back to opposing Zeus himself. **Poseidon's attitudes towards Zeus here are not solid. Instead, they shift and sway, much like water does**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Source: [A History of Poseidon by Robert James Reese, 2002](http://robertjamesreese.com/essays/a-history-of-poseidon)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further reading: http://www.maicar.com/GML/Poseidon.html" />

This *kind of* qualifies as a cult of Hercules perhaps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Significant here is the epigraphic evidence for the cult of Hercules Magusanus. Hercules Magusanus is a god with a double name, a Roman and an indigenous one respectively, and we should regard him as a syncretism of the Roman Hercules with Magusanus, a local deity or hero. The cult was based in Germania Inferior, particularly the Batavian region, as attested to by the distribution of votive inscriptions and the presence of some monumental sanctuaries that can be ascribed to this deity.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Roymans, Nico. *Ethnic Identity and Imperial Power: The Batavians in the Early Roman Empire*.

Hera, ever jealous was constantly after him. As a result, Zeus kept trying different tricks with which to hide from her (which never worked). Once, he tried blanketing the earth in clouds and transforming [Io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Io_(mythology)) into a cow. From [Ovid's *Metamorphoses*](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/Metamorph.htm#anchor_Toc64105476):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   &gt; Meanwhile Juno looked down into the heart of Argos, surprised that rapid mists had created night in shining daylight. She knew they were not vapours from the river, or breath from the damp earth. She looked around to see where her husband was, knowing by now the intrigues of a spouse so often caught in the act. When she could not find him in the skies, she said ‘Either I am wrong, or being wronged’ and gliding down from heaven’s peak, she stood on earth ordering the clouds to melt. Jupiter had a presage of his wife’s arrival and had changed Inachus’s daughter into a gleaming heifer. Even in that form she was beautiful. Saturnia approved the animal’s looks, though grudgingly, asking, then, whose she was, where from, what herd, as if she did not know. Jupiter, to stop all inquiry, lied, saying she had been born from the earth. Then Saturnia claimed her as a gift. What could he do? Cruel to sacrifice his love, but suspicious not to. Shame urges him to it, Amor urges not. Amor would have conquered Shame, but if he refused so slight a gift as a heifer to the companion of his race and bed, it might appear no heifer!&#xD;&#xA;2. The women themselves were almost never interested, and so he transformed himself to make them more willing. This happened all the time; [a good example was in the myth](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus3.html#10) of [Leda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leda_(mythology)) / [Nemesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nemesis_(mythology)):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &gt; But Zeus in the form of a swan consorted with Leda, and on the same night Tyndareus cohabited with her; and she bore Pollux and Helen to Zeus, and Castor and Clytaemnestra to Tyndareus. But some say that Helen was a daughter of Nemesis and Zeus; for that she, flying from the arms of Zeus, changed herself into a goose, but Zeus in his turn took the likeness of a swan and so enjoyed her; and as the fruit of their loves she laid an egg, and a certain shepherd found it in the groves and brought and gave it to Leda; and she put it in a chest and kept it; and when Helen was hatched in due time, Leda brought her up as her own daughter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, for one or the other of these reasons, Zeus pretty much had no choice, if he wanted to keep raping every beautiful woman he met. And he was the king of the gods, so he certainly wasn't going to give *that* up." />

There have been instances where Poseidon is jealous about Zeus' position as the King of gods. However, the same instance is said to be inspired by a conflict of interests, as Poseidon was not satisfied with Zeus' rule. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Poseidon took once part in a minor conspiracy in heaven; for he, along with Hera and Athena, had agreed to put Zeus in bonds. However, he was saved by Briareus (one of the HECATONCHEIRES), whom Achilles' mother Thetis had called to Zeus' rescue; and by just squatting down close to him and through the mere display of his force, Briareus frightened Poseidon and the goddesses away.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Source: http://www.igreekmythology.com/poseidon.html#L1&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But, his views towards Zeus was not always filled with jealousy. There have been times when Poseidon helped Zeus with his troubles and also fought beside him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He allied himself with Zeus in the battles against the Giants and repeatedly helped Zeus’s lovers. For example, he calmed the sea so Zeus, disguised as a bull, could cross it with Europa. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Source: [Mythology 101: From Gods and Goddesses to Monsters and Mortals, Your Guide to Ancient Mythology](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7x9EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA73&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;dq=poseidon+conspired+against+Zeus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VpWgrhJiWv&amp;sig=-6szBPKYyTd1m6C2kVmVKobAinI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7fpBVf32DsHYmAWPzYHgDA&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=poseidon%20conspired%20against%20Zeus&amp;f=false)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Looking into the case more deeply, Poseidon was not overly jealous of his younger brother and had a sense of respect towards him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In Book Eight, Hera comes to Poseidon and asks him to join forces with her against Zeus, who is aiding the Trojans. His response displays the way in which his attitudes can change quickly. &quot;But the Earth-Shaker growled at her in anger: 'Hera, mistress of babble that you are, what empty-headed talk is this? I would not dream of pitting all the rest of us against Lord Zeus. He overmasters all'&quot; (188). Poseidon had recently attempted to dethrone Zeus on his own, but now became angered at Hera for even mentioning the idea. He switches his opinion again soon after this, however. In Book Thirteen, he chooses to disregard Zeus' orders to stay out of the combat and intervenes on behalf of the Achaeans. &quot;Rancor within him deepened against Zeus… from the deep water, girdler of earth and shaker of earth, Poseidon came to arouse new spirit in the Argives&quot; (300). He went from conspiring against Zeus, to anger at the mere mention of opposing Zeus, and back to opposing Zeus himself. **Poseidon's attitudes towards Zeus here are not solid. Instead, they shift and sway, much like water does**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sup&gt;Source: [A History of Poseidon by Robert James Reese, 2002](http://robertjamesreese.com/essays/a-history-of-poseidon)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Further reading: http://www.maicar.com/GML/Poseidon.html&lt;/sup&gt;" />

In terms of math, it seems to be involved in lots of combinations as shown:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The numbers 1,2 and 3 are all prime numbers and are symbolic of creation through the holy trinity. The number 12 would be reduced in numerology as 1+2=3, which means that the number 12 is also symbolic of the trinity. According to the rules of music vibration, we know that octaves of the fundamental vibration are created through multiplication or division from the number two. Two times twelve is 24 and half of 12 is 6. It is interesting to note that all prime numbers greater than 3 (the original trinity of prime numbers) are properties of the number six. The formula for creating prime numbers is 6n + 1where n is any number and + 1 is symbolic of unity or the original cause. For example: 6*2 = 12 and 12 – 1 is 11 and 12 + 1 is 13 and 11 and 13 are prime numbers. 6 *3 is 18 and 18 – 1 is 17 and 18 + 1 is 19 and both 17 and 19 are prime numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Religiously, it is known as the symbolic of the creation of the universe as it represents the division or fractionating of unity (God) into twelve individual distinct vibrations or tones.

The four of them would pair off to oppose each other.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; When they gathered together to play in the ballcourt, the Falcon would&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arrive to watch over them.

Among various sites on the internet [1][1] [2][2] [3][3] [4][4], there's this passage which suggests that he is a *compilation of various supreme gods*:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Zeus was  mighty, glorious, awesome and wise, although he did show a certain degree of surprising foolishness and naiveness when it came to hiding his love affairs. **Some historians attribute this less than noble behavior of the &quot;noblest one of all&quot; to the fact that Zeus was most likely a compilation of many &quot;supreme gods&quot; from different areas.** When his worship spread to an area which already worshipped another god, some of that god’s qualities as well as his wife or lover were transferred to Zeus. Aside from the endless affairs Zeus was different from other gods in that he did not participate in the arguments and the resulting petty scheming that made up the daily activities of other gods. Being this wise ruler, he also demanded just and righteous action from men. Zeus was however vengeful, as can be seen in The creation of man by Prometheus, but only rightly so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately, this passage is unsourced and those sites might all be plagiarising some unknown, original source.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is this assertion true, was Zeus a compilation of other gods, combining their qualities?

The Argonauts were desperate for food and water, and Medea decided to use her magic to kill Talos. She &quot;sent forth baneful phantoms&quot; and as Talos was trying to stop them from reaching [Dikti](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dikti) (Europa's hideout), he accidentaly &quot;grazed his ankle on a pointed crag&quot;, releasing the [ichor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ichor) from his single vein. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's the story, as told in [Argonautica](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonautica): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And Talos, the man of bronze, as he broke off rocks from the hard cliff, stayed them from fastening hawsers to the shore, when they came to the roadstead of Dicte's haven. He was of the stock of bronze, of the men sprung from ash-trees, the last left among the sons of the gods; and the son of Cronos gave him to Europa to be the warder of Crete and to stride round the island thrice a day with his feet of bronze. Now in all the rest of his body and limbs was he fashioned of bronze and invulnerable; but beneath the sinew by his ankle was a blood-red vein; and this, with its issues of life and death, was covered by a thin skin. So the heroes, though outworn with toil, quickly backed their ship from the land in sore dismay. And now far from Crete would they have been borne in wretched plight, distressed both by thirst and pain, had not Medea addressed them as they turned away:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Hearken to me. For I deem that I alone can subdue for you that man, whoever he be, even though his frame be of bronze throughout, unless his life too is everlasting. But be ready to keep your ship here beyond the cast of his stones, till he yield the victory to me.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus she spake; and they drew the ship out of range, resting on their oars, waiting to see what plan unlooked for she would bring to pass; and she, holding the fold of her purple robe over her cheeks on each side, mounted on the deck; and Aeson's son took her hand in his and guided her way along the thwarts. And with songs did she propitiate and invoke the Death-spirits, devourers of life, the swift hounds of Hades, who, hovering through all the air, swoop down on the living. Kneeling in supplication, thrice she called on them with songs, and thrice with prayers; and, shaping her soul to mischief, with her hostile glance she bewitched the eyes of Talos, the man of bronze; and her teeth gnashed bitter wrath against him, and she sent forth baneful phantoms in the frenzy of her rage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Father Zeus, surely great wonder rises in my mind, seeing that dire destruction meets us not from disease and wounds alone, but lo! even from afar, may be, it tortures us! So Talos, for all his frame of bronze, yielded the victory to the might of Medea the sorceress. And as he was heaving massy rocks to stay them from reaching the haven, he grazed his ankle on a pointed crag; and the ichor gushed forth like melted lead; and not long thereafter did he stand towering on the jutting cliff. But even as some huge pine, high up on the mountains, which woodmen have left half hewn through by their sharp axes when they returned from the forest—at first it shivers in the wind by night, then at last snaps at the stump and crashes down; so Talos for a while stood on his tireless feet, swaying to and fro, when at last, all strengthless, fell with a mighty thud. For that night there in Crete the heroes lay; then, just as dawn was growing bright, they built a shrine to Minoan Athena, and drew water and went aboard, so that first of all they might by rowing pass beyond Salmone's height.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Project Gutenberg EBook of The Argonautica, by Apollonius Rhodius](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/830/830-h/830-h.htm)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;" />

In the myths relating to him, male energy is presented as having shaped the world and created the life forms that belong to the land. Every human man - every tāne - who fathered a child was re-enacting the occasion on which Tāne, having obtained a wife, fathered the first of his children.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He married women because that was the essence of who he was.

I was born in the mountains...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He is described in *[The Epic of Gilgamesh][3]*, tablet 2, as:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Humbaba's roar is a flood, his mouth is death and his breath is fire! He can hear a hundred leagues away any [rustling?] in his forest!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He was not, however, a mechanical creature such as a robot, as such things did not exist in Ancient Mesopotamia. He had human characteristics, and a physical body which Gilgamesh could capture: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; they pulled out his insides including his tongue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (tablet 5, *[The Epic of Gilgamesh][4]*) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Huwawa bared his teeth at him [...] He tied up his arms like a captured man [...] Huwawa sat down and began to weep, shedding tears...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He is also easily slayed by Enkidu:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Enkidu, full of rage and anger, cut his throat...  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, Enlil adds further evidence to Huwawa's mortal characteristics when, upset by Huwawa's death, he cries out:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He should have eaten the bread that you eat, and should have drunk the water that you drink. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (all quotes from *[Gilgamesh and Huwawa][5]* unless mentioned) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He appears, then, to be a monstrous but mortal creature.

The Noahide flood myth is detailed in Genesis chapters 6 through 9 of the Jewish/Christian Bible. The Ziusudra flood myth is from a single tablet often called Eridu Genesis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarities&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Both floods are brought about by divine intervention.&#xD;&#xA;* Both floods were for the express purpose to destroy mankind.&#xD;&#xA;* Both persons build an ark to survive the flood.&#xD;&#xA;* Both persons save pairs of animals as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Differences&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Ziusudra was a king; Genesis neither states nor implies that Noah is anything other than average.&#xD;&#xA;* Ziusudra is part of a mythology that involves a pantheon of gods; Noah exists within the monotheistic Jewish mythology.&#xD;&#xA;* Enlil, a god to Ziusudra, was annoyed by all the noise that human cities and activities made, so he persuaded the other gods to wipe out mankind. Noah's God was grieved that he had ever made mankind because every thought and action of their's was only wicked, so he decided to destroy them.&#xD;&#xA;* Enki, another god to Ziusudra, was fond of Ziusudra so he resolved to save him in some way. Noah's God seems to be conflicted, favoring Noah because he is actually not wicked, so God resolves to save Noah, his family, and the animals.&#xD;&#xA;* Ziusudra is rewarded by the gods with immortality. Within the myth itself, Noah is not rewarded with anything (some theologies certainly say he has eternal life, but that is not derived from the myth itself). In fact, Noah praises God and sacrifices and worships!&#xD;&#xA;* Ziusudra's gods don't seem bothered that so many were killed. Noah's God promises that he will never again destroy mankind, showing perhaps regret for the whole affair.&#xD;&#xA;* Ziusudra's flood myth doesn't seem to bother with rebuilding and re-population; there's no pragmatism, as is typical for myths. Noah's flood myth goes into this a great deal (i.e. there's genealogies, locations named, who settled where, etc.) and the stories in Genesis start to sound a little more plausible and less like epic legends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Conclusions&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The dating of each myth suggests that the Sumerian Flood Epic (2300 BCE) may very well have influenced the development of the Jewish Flood Epic (1400 BCE to 700 BCE depending on who you ask). Many scholars believe that the whole Genesis creation myth (the first 11 chapters of Genesis) was influenced by the Babylonian version of the epic of Gilgamesh, which does mention a flood. Further, the Jewish people were held captive by the Babylonians in the 7th century BCE. This surely influenced their culture and already existing myths.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jewish culture stands out among most other ancient cultures. Generally, they were xenophobic and extremely resistant to syncretism. They would fall away and worship other gods, but they were always defined by their &quot;one true God&quot;. You can see this in the Noahide adaptation of &quot;the flood that wiped out mankind&quot;. In Ziusudra's myth, the gods look at man like a plaything that entertains and aggravates them. The Jewish god loves his creation dearly and is grieved when they do wrong, not annoyed. Ziusudra's gods are one dimensional, having particular characteristics and persuasions, while the Jewish god is multifaceted and sometimes seems to contradict himself as a consequence of adapting these epics to revolve around a monotheism. In light of this, the differences between the two myths makes sense, while the core similarities remain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sources**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* [The Eridu Genesis][1]&#xD;&#xA;* [Genesis 6-9][2]&#xD;&#xA;* [Ancient History Encyclopedia - Eridu][3]&#xD;&#xA;* [Wikipedia - Babylonian Captivity - Exilic literature and post-exilic revisions of the Torah/Pentateuch][4] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.piney.com/EriduGen.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%206-9&amp;version=NIV&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ancient.eu/eridu/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity#Exilic_literature_and_post-exilic_revisions_of_the_Torah.2FPentateuch" />

People worshiped the sky, which eventually became Jupiter, the god of the sky. But by the time we get to 30 BC with the advent of the Imperial Cult, they are still talking about it. So they didn't abandon it as a primitive understanding of the gods, but embraced it as fundamental to divinity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So around 30 BC, at the advent of the Imperial Cult, how did the Romans at this time typically understand how the Genii fit into the mythology?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some side questions spawn out of this so here they are out of curiosity, not expectation that they should be answered:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1.

Here's something I found on [Egypt Tour](https://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/pyramidreligion.htm):&#xD;&#xA;&gt;One of their earliest creation myths envisioned the first place in the world as a mound of earth emerging from the waters of a universal ocean.[...]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It seems that the earliest temples of Egypt, particularly in the north, sometimes incorporated a mound of earth as a symbol of the original site of all life. The earliest such mounds may have been a small hill of earth or sand, but the icon eventually took the form of a small pyramid carved from a single block of stone, known as a bnbn (benben). This name comes from the root, bn, which means to &quot;sell up&quot; or &quot;swell forth&quot;. The benben also, because of the sun's part in creation, came to be an icon of both the primeval mound as well as the sun which rose from it. In fact, the Egyptian word for the rising sun is wbn, which comes from the same root as benben.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The above extract tells how the &quot;rising mound of earth&quot; was imitated by the pyramids and how the Egyptians considered it sacred. That sacred feeling was achieved by the Egyptians through the construction of the pyramids.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Multiple sources do confirm that the Egyptian pyramids were based on their beliefs on benben:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;First of all, they reflect the shape of the primordial mound of creation &quot;benben&quot;. According to the Egyptian creation myth, which describes how the world was born, benben was an earthly mound that appeared out of the water and produced the first God.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;source: [Function of the Egyptian Pyramids](http://www.experience-ancient-egypt.com/egyptian-pyramids.html)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pyramid was not only a recreation of the benben, but along with it, the pyramids were considered to be the steps to heaven, where at the peak, they (Pharaohs) could greet the Sun god, Ra.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Moreover, the origin of the monument, hitherto overlooked, made it a symbol of the highest sacredness, rising above the mortal remains of the king, to greet the Sun, whose offspring the Pharaoh was.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;source: [LECTURE III THE REALMS OF THE DEAD—THE PYRAMID TEXTS—THE ASCENT TO THE SKY](http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/rtae/rtae07.htm)&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is said that the myth is confirmed in the [Pyramid Texts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Texts).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The central motif involves two twins born of the sky deity (or sun), with some customary attributes such as being horsemen or riding horse-drawn chariots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Another manifestation of the binary conception of society and the world is the cult of twins widespread in Indo-European mythology. A myth of divine twins who are children of the sun god goes back to Proto-Indo-European antiquity. The myth is found in all the main ancient Indo-European traditions, which not only repeat the same motfisbut also share correspondences in the names of the heroes, thus establishing the Proto-Indo-European character of the motif and the personages.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Gamkrelidze, T.

When her head was cut off, there sprang from the Gorgon the winged horse Pegasus and Chrysaor, the father of Geryon; these she had by Poseidon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [Apollod. 2.4.2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0022%3Atext%3DLibrary%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D4%3Asection%3D2#note6)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be noted, however, that Hesiod doesn't mention the shield at all: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And again, Ceto bore to Phorcys the fair-cheeked Graiae, sisters grey from their birth: and both deathless gods and men who walk on earth call them Graiae, Pemphredo well-clad, and saffron-robed Enyo, and the Gorgons who dwell beyond glorious Ocean in the frontier land towards Night where are the clear-voiced Hesperides, Sthenno, and Euryale, and Medusa who suffered a woeful fate: she was mortal, but the two were undying and grew not old. With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers. And when Perseus cut off her head, there sprang forth great Chrysaor and the horse Pegasus who is so called because he was born near the springs of Ocean; and that other, because he held a golden blade in his hands. Now Pegasus flew away and left the earth, the mother of flocks, and came to the deathless gods: and he dwells in the house of Zeus and brings to wise Zeus the thunder and lightning&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [Hes.

The ballgame was called tlaxtli or tlachtli. The court consisted of two walls with some twenty or thirty feet of distance between them and each was up to forty or fifty feet in length. The floor and walls were heavily plastered, the latter having some one and a half estados [nearly ten feet] in height. In the middle of the court was a line made especially for the game; and in the middle of the walls, halfway down the playing stretch, were two stones like millstones perforated in the middle, facing each other, and they each had holes wide enough that the ball could fit into each of them. And whoever placed the ball there won the game. They did not play with their hands but hit the ball with their flanks. For playing they wore gloves on their hands and a leather apron on their flanks to hit the ball (Sahagún 1938, II.viii.10, pp. 297-298).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# The Game's Role in the Plot&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to summarise, the general plot of the Popol Vuh is one of a creation myth. It tells the story of how the gods created the worlds, the animals, and of the god's several attempts to create humans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important thing to note is that the reason behind the failure of the gods several attempts to create humans is that their attempts could not speak the names of the gods (e.g. know of them or worship them). Here's an example of this (this passage accounts why just creating animals was insufficient):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Speak therefore our names. Worship  us, for we are your Mother and your Father. Say this, therefore: ‘Huracan, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth, Framer and Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons.’ Speak! Call upon us! Worship us!” they were told.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; But they did not succeed. They did not speak like people. They only squawked and chattered and roared. Their speech was unrecognizable, for each cried out in a&#xD;&#xA;different way.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;When they heard this, the Framer and the Shaper said, “Their speech did not&#xD;&#xA;&gt;turn out well.”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;And again they said to each other:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “They were not able to speak our names. We are their Framer and their Shaper.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is not good,” said She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Xibalba (the underworld) doesn't appear until after three failed creation attempts (the second and third attempts failed for the same reason as the first creation attempt). They first appear to oppose the fathers of the twins, &quot;One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu,&quot; who, it is important to note, were &quot;born to Xpiyacoc and Xmucane&quot; (two of the seven gods who created the world) ([Christenson][3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “What is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping about and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall come to play ball, and we&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shall defeat them. They have simply failed to honor us. They have neither honor nor&#xD;&#xA;&gt; respect. Certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads,” said therefore all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; those of Xibalba.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Christenson][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should become clear that the lords of Xibalba are an opposing force to the creation god(desses). Not only are they the lords of death, but they, like the lords of creation, also want recognition from humans. As explained in the online book [*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][1]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (which uses a different translation of the Popol Vuh):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We have here a contest between opposing forces, since those of Xibalbá cannot tolerate that &quot; 'anyone greater than they, or any having greater power, should exist,' they all said unanimously.&quot; From this passage it is seen that the organization of the false gods is similar to that of the true since, like the latter, the false gods compose a sevenfold entity whose components must get together and reach decisions by a unanimity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the plot perspective, the game &quot;ball&quot; is simply a competition to resolve the conflict, and the story wouldn't be much different if they played chess or another game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Just to clarify the plot: One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu are defeated by Xibalba, but their sons learn to play ball, go to Xibalba, and defeat the Lords of Xibalba. Afterwords, humans are finally created.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# The Symbolic Interpretation of the Game&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, another way of looking at the game is as a symbol representing the sky. From [*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Besides symbolizing the sun's relative position in the order of its rising and its daily trajectory, Hunahpú and Ixbalamqué, playing alone for a long time on opposite sides of the court, represent the position of the sun and the moon at opposing solstices, just as this continues to be depicted on Chortí altars. All this unmistakably reflects a gradual progress in astronomic and cosmogonic knowledge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Popol Vuh is the only American source to speak of the origin of the ball game and place it in time. Not only does it tell us of the game's ethnological antiquity, it also explains its symbolism. It in fact establishes a parallel between the ball players and the solar gods, which from the angles of the universe — to employ the phraseology of the Chumayel manuscript — meet in the center, in this case in the ball court, where they can convert themselves into two and even four persons with no loss of their theogonic individuality, at once a unity and a multiplicity. During the ball game they wear their resplendent ceremonial gear — that is, they exhibit their insignia as solar deities. Two by two they come from the eastern and western sectors of the cosmos and, meeting in the center, forge themselves into the individuality of Heart of Heaven. This fusion of a number of forms under &quot;one single head,&quot; as the Chortís say, is expressed in the principal rule of the game which is that the players can touch the ball only with their body but never with their heads, feet, or arms; each time this happens a point is given the other team. The continual contact of two or four bodies with a single ball makes clear the monotheistic principle whereby the deity integrates itself through the union of its hypostases. This idea is objectified in the group of ball players unable to use their heads or extremities since the ball — the symbol of the Star or Sun god — is alternatively the head of each. This figure of a single-headed god having many bodies is characteristic of Maya thought. We need only to remember Oxlahun-oc (&quot;it of the thirteen feet&quot;), who is mentioned in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel. The motion of the ball imitates the trajectory of the sun, a figure that the Chortí actors also reproduce in their dramatization of this part of the Popol Vuh. Besides this, the Quiché codex represents the descent of god-Seven from the Center of Heaven to the center of the earth by the solar bird which, coming down from on high, &quot;came to see them play.&quot; As said, in Chortí religious allegory the bird of prey, which is the mask, nahual, or messenger of the deity of Heaven, descends vertically to the center of the earth — like the sun's rays — when the daystar goes through the zenith, symbolizing the descent of divine grace. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This interpretation lends a new interpretation to the text: Xibalba, the &quot;Lords of the subterrene regions&quot; ([*Esotericism*][1]) are in conflict with the lords of the sky (the creators) over power. The punishment of the Lords of Xibalba (&quot;you... shall no longer be allowed to play ball.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) reflects that Xibalba is restricted to a subteranian sphere, and that the power of death is limited. This may be one of the reasons why the gods can then create humans who &quot;can speak their name.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, we don't know enough to know without a doubt the real symbolism behind the ball game&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The conquistadors deliberately supressed indiginous culture when they conquored central america, and only four written mayan documents remain. It's impossible to understate the destruction that these cultures faced, and we are very fortunate that texts like the Popol Vuh still exist.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I am continuously amazed at the quality of sources on mythology available online. Why would anyone want to read wikipedia?  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This line does not occur in the Christenson translation, but the Lords of Xibalba still faced severe restrictions on their power.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; There is disagreement about the meaning of the ball game.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A good account of the translation can be found [on JStor (behind a paywall)][2].

This also means that there are many different versions of the same story.&lt;sup&gt;[[3]]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One big problem is that all these stories are completely separate. The Aboriginal people do not have a single *physical* &quot;holy book&quot;, as some religions do, nor do they have a certain set of deities. Rather, they believe that certain spirits - often nameless - or ancestors were responsible for the creation of certain things in their world. These ancestors can take very different forms - not necessarily human - depending on which people are telling the story.&lt;sup&gt;[[4]]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some specific stories about how certain creatures arose, or how certain features formed. Attempts have been made to correlate these with actual archaeological dates. Unfortunately, there isn't necessarily a connection between when the Aboriginal legends arose and when the things they talk about arose.&lt;sup&gt;[[5]]&lt;/sup&gt; One claim says that some stories go back 65,000 years, making it possible that the stories correctly told of when the creatures were created, if not the actual accurate process.&lt;sup&gt;[[3]]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these stories make up the legends of the Dreamtime, but the creation of the world itself in Aboriginal lore is not connected with all of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is impossible to date all of the different Dreamtime stories, but it seems like you're asking about the actual creation of the world/universe. The exact details of the myth(s) of this period have never been shared with non-Aboriginals, so almost nothing is known about them. There *are* a few separate answers. Some groups believe that the Dreamtime is/was eternal. This belief goes hand in hand with the idea that the Dreamtime is still occurring. The Gunwinggu follow this belief. Another belief is that the creation happened &quot;a long time ago&quot;, or in &quot;the distant past&quot;. Most myths are not concerned with an exact date, simply stating that it happened a long, long time ago.&lt;sup&gt;[[6]]&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most comprehensive source I could find on the Dreamtime was [*The Australian Aboriginal &quot;Dreamtime&quot; (Its History, Cosmogenesis Cosmology&#xD;&#xA;and Ontology)* by Colin Dean](http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/religion/DREAMTIME1.pdf), which was my source for the last paragraph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I'm choosing to use &quot;Dreamtime&quot; throughout the answer to refer to the entire collection of myths, though thanks to competing translations and large language differences, different terms can be used to mean different things.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: http://www.kateowengallery.com/page/Aboriginal-Dreamtime-Stories.aspx&#xD;&#xA; [2]: http://www.aboriginalartonline.com/culture/dreamtim.php&#xD;&#xA; [3]: http://www.gadimirrabooka.com/dreamtime&#xD;&#xA; [4]: http://www.australianhistory.org/dreamtime&#xD;&#xA; [5]: http://www.aboriginalstories.org.au/aboriginal-storytelling&#xD;&#xA; [6]: http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/religion/DREAMTIME1.pdf" />

The central motif involves two twins born of the sky deity (or sun), with some customary attributes such as being horsemen or riding horse-drawn chariots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Another manifestation of the binary conception of society and the world is the cult of twins widespread in Indo-European mythology. A myth of divine twins who are children of the sun god goes back to Proto-Indo-European antiquity. The myth is found in all the main ancient Indo-European traditions, which not only repeat the same motfisbut also share correspondences in the names of the heroes, thus establishing the Proto-Indo-European character of the motif and the personages.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Gamkrelidze, T.

They sent him on ahead to obtain for&#xD;&#xA;them what he could hear:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;... &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Next he bit the third one seated there, who was One Death—“Ouch!” said&#xD;&#xA;&gt; each one when he was bitten. “What?” was their reply:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Ow!” said One Death.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “What, One Death? What is it?”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “I am being bitten!”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “It’s just . . . Ow! What was that? Now I am being bitten!” said the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fourth one seated there.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “What, Seven Death? What is it?”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “I am being bitten!”&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[this goes on for some time]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus their names were named. Each of them revealed the name of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; other. Each of the individuals in order of their rank had his name&#xD;&#xA;&gt; revealed by the one who sat next to him, Not one of their names was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; missed until all of the names were named when they were bitten by a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hair that Hunahpu had plucked from the front of his knee. It wasn’t&#xD;&#xA;&gt; really a mosquito that had bitten them. And so Hunahpu and Xbalanque&#xD;&#xA;&gt; heard the names of all of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This allows the twins to name all of the Lords of Xibalba, and thus have power over them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; All of them had their faces revealed, for all of their names were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; named. Not one of their names was missed. When they were called upon,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; they gave the names of each one without leaving any of them out.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Contrast this to how the parents of the twins were tricked by the Lords of Xibalba because they didn't know their names:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus they [One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu, the parents of the twins Hunahpú and Ixbalamqué] did not prevail [because they didn't know who the Lords of Xibalba were, and confused them with wooden statues]. Instead, the lords of Xibalba roared &#xD;&#xA;&gt; with laughter. They merely roared with laughter, all the lords,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; because they had completely prevailed. In their hearts, they had&#xD;&#xA;&gt; defeated One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(the above quotations are all from [the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This scene recalls other Central American stories where the hero gains power over others through magical projectiles:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But, adds the Quiché account, &quot;in reality it wasn't the mosquito that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; bit and went to hear all the names, but rather a hair that Hunahpú&#xD;&#xA;&gt; plucked out of his shinbone, and it was this that stung them and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; obliged them to say their names.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; This clearly defines the magical technique of affecting events from a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; distance, through invisible darts that sting like the mosquito but&#xD;&#xA;&gt; which really express the personal magical power of the sender. That&#xD;&#xA;&gt; method, invented by Hunahpú, a sage par excellence, explains the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; origin of an interesting magical practice employed by one class of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Chortí wise men, who &quot;foretell by means of the calf of the leg,&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; imitating the pattern laid down by the god-hero who found out the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; names of his adversaries by means of a hair torn from his shin. An&#xD;&#xA;&gt; identical procedure, consisting of throwing out magical darts, is also&#xD;&#xA;&gt; used by Chortí elders who declare they &quot;have shot the god-Seven&quot; when&#xD;&#xA;&gt; by magical art they succeed in making the Agrarian deity descend to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the center of the earth. A similar method is also mentioned in Mexican&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sources which say that the sun, having come to a halt, was stung by a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mosquito in its leg. Ixtlilxóchitl says of this that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; during the Third Age [equivalent to the Age in which the Popol Vuh places the invention of shooting out such magical darts], the sun&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; stood still for one full day without moving from its place; and as the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; mosquito saw the sun so still and pensive, it said, &quot;Lord of the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; World, why are you so still and thoughtful and why don't you carry out&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; your duty as you are ordered? Do you want to destroy the world, as you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; are now doing?&quot; And seeing that the sun was silent and did not answer,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; the mosquito approached and bit it on the leg. Feeling itself bitten,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; the sun began to travel its usual course again.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In another version it is Citli who shoots an arrow at the sun but, the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; arrow having missed its mark, the sun kills Citli.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/christenson/popolvuh.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/popolvuh/pv-hp.htm" />

No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you with notices from house to house till I got paid in full, whereas now I have no remedy.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With this Telemachus dashed his staff to the ground and burst into tears. Every one was very sorry for him, but they all sat still and no one ventured to make him an angry answer, save only Antinous, who spoke thus: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Telemachus, insolent braggart that you are, how dare you try to throw the blame upon us suitors? It is your mother's fault not ours, for she is a very artful woman. This three years past, and close on four, she has been driving us out of our minds, by encouraging each one of us, and sending him messages without meaning one word of what she says. And then there was that other trick she played us. She set up a great tambour frame in her room, and began to work on an enormous piece of fine needlework. 'Sweet hearts,' said she, 'Ulysses is indeed dead, still do not press me to marry again immediately, wait- for I would not have skill in needlework perish unrecorded- till I have completed a pall for the hero Laertes, to be in readiness against the time when death shall take him.

No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I shall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion. Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased and turn upon you.

For them, much of what transpired is a private matter, and so only some stories can be accessed. ([Aboriginal Dreamtime Stories - Jukurrpa][1], [Gadi Mirrabooka Aboriginal Stories][3], [*The Australian Aboriginal &quot;Dreamtime&quot; (Its History, Cosmogenesis Cosmology&#xD;&#xA;and Ontology)* by Colin Dean][6])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The idea of the Dreamtime&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is an interesting and complex part of Aboriginal culture. As [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreamtime) says, the word was a (mis)translation of an Aboriginal word, *alcheringa*, also transliterated as *altjira*. The Dreamtime, however, is not just a past event. It existed thousands of years ago, exists in the present, and will exist far into the future. It is an entity that forms the basis for Aboriginal spirituality, rituals, and history. Another word, *tjurjunga*, is perhaps a better description of this facet of the concept. ([Aboriginal Art Online][2]) However, different tribes have different languages, and so the usage varies across Australia; *alcheringa* is simply one of the most commonly used terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many different Dreamtime stories, arising from the fact that the Aboriginal people are not one group, but a collection of related cultures that happen to live on the same continent. This also means that there are many different versions of the same story. ([Gadi Mirrabooka Aboriginal Stories][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One big problem is that all these stories are completely separate. The Aboriginal people do not have a single *physical* &quot;holy book&quot;, as some religions do, nor do they have a certain set of deities. Rather, they believe that certain spirits - often nameless - or ancestors were responsible for the creation of certain things in their world. These ancestors can take very different forms - not necessarily human - depending on which people are telling the story. ([Australian History - Dreamtime][4])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are some specific stories about how certain creatures arose, or how certain features formed. Attempts have been made to correlate these with actual archaeological dates. Unfortunately, there isn't necessarily a connection between when the Aboriginal legends arose and when the things they talk about arose. ([Aboriginal Stories][5]) One claim says that some stories go back 65,000 years, making it possible that the stories correctly told of when the creatures were created, if not the actual accurate process. ([Gadi Mirrabooka Aboriginal Stories][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All of these stories make up the legends of the Dreamtime, but the creation of the world itself in Aboriginal lore is not connected with all of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is impossible to date all of the different Dreamtime stories, but it seems like you're asking about the actual creation of the world/universe. The exact details of the myth(s) of this period have never been shared with non-Aboriginals, so almost nothing is known about them. There *are* a few separate answers. Some groups believe that the Dreamtime is/was eternal. This belief goes hand in hand with the idea that the Dreamtime is still occurring. The Gunwinggu follow this belief. Another belief is that the creation happened &quot;a long time ago&quot;, or in &quot;the distant past&quot;. Most myths are not concerned with an exact date, simply stating that it happened a long, long time ago. ([*The Australian Aboriginal &quot;Dreamtime&quot; (Its History, Cosmogenesis Cosmology&#xD;&#xA;and Ontology)* by Colin Dean][6])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most comprehensive source I could find on the Dreamtime was [*The Australian Aboriginal &quot;Dreamtime&quot; (Its History, Cosmogenesis Cosmology&#xD;&#xA;and Ontology)* by Colin Dean][6], which was my source for the last paragraph.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I'm choosing to use &quot;Dreamtime&quot; throughout the answer to refer to the entire collection of myths, though thanks to competing translations and large language differences, different terms can be used to mean different things.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: http://www.kateowengallery.com/page/Aboriginal-Dreamtime-Stories.aspx&#xD;&#xA; [2]: http://www.aboriginalartonline.com/culture/dreamtim.php&#xD;&#xA; [3]: http://www.gadimirrabooka.com/dreamtime&#xD;&#xA; [4]: http://www.australianhistory.org/dreamtime&#xD;&#xA; [5]: http://www.aboriginalstories.org.au/aboriginal-storytelling&#xD;&#xA; [6]: http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/books/religion/DREAMTIME1.pdf" />

There is a cyclic nature for birth, death and (re)birth and the divinity does not consider the death of the creations-children as something evil (even if its _eating_ them). It is part of the cycle." />

The ballgame was called tlaxtli or tlachtli. The court consisted of two walls with some twenty or thirty feet of distance between them and each was up to forty or fifty feet in length. The floor and walls were heavily plastered, the latter having some one and a half estados [nearly ten feet] in height. In the middle of the court was a line made especially for the game; and in the middle of the walls, halfway down the playing stretch, were two stones like millstones perforated in the middle, facing each other, and they each had holes wide enough that the ball could fit into each of them. And whoever placed the ball there won the game. They did not play with their hands but hit the ball with their flanks. For playing they wore gloves on their hands and a leather apron on their flanks to hit the ball (Sahagún 1938, II.viii.10, pp. 297-298).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# The Game's Role in the Plot&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to summarise, the general plot of the Popol Vuh is one of a creation myth. It tells the story of how the gods created the worlds, the animals, and of the god's several attempts to create humans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important thing to note is that the reason behind the failure of the gods several attempts to create humans is that their attempts could not speak the names of the gods (e.g. know of them or worship them). Here's an example of this (this passage accounts why just creating animals was insufficient):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Speak therefore our names. Worship  us, for we are your Mother and your Father. Say this, therefore: ‘Huracan, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth, Framer and Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons.’ Speak! Call upon us! Worship us!” they were told.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; But they did not succeed. They did not speak like people. They only squawked and chattered and roared. Their speech was unrecognizable, for each cried out in a&#xD;&#xA;different way.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;When they heard this, the Framer and the Shaper said, “Their speech did not&#xD;&#xA;&gt;turn out well.”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;And again they said to each other:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “They were not able to speak our names. We are their Framer and their Shaper.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is not good,” said She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Xibalba (the underworld) doesn't appear until after three failed creation attempts (the second and third attempts failed for the same reason as the first creation attempt). They first appear to oppose the fathers of the twins, &quot;One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu,&quot; who, it is important to note, were &quot;born to Xpiyacoc and Xmucane&quot; (two of the seven gods who created the world) ([Christenson][3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “What is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping about and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall come to play ball, and we&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shall defeat them. They have simply failed to honor us. They have neither honor nor&#xD;&#xA;&gt; respect. Certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads,” said therefore all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; those of Xibalba.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Christenson][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should become clear that the lords of Xibalba are an opposing force to the creation god(desses). Not only are they the lords of death, but they, like the lords of creation, also want recognition from humans. As explained in the online book [*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][1]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (which uses a different translation of the Popol Vuh):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We have here a contest between opposing forces, since those of Xibalbá cannot tolerate that &quot; 'anyone greater than they, or any having greater power, should exist,' they all said unanimously.&quot; From this passage it is seen that the organization of the false gods is similar to that of the true since, like the latter, the false gods compose a sevenfold entity whose components must get together and reach decisions by a unanimity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the plot perspective, the game &quot;ball&quot; is simply a competition to resolve the conflict, and the story wouldn't be much different if they played chess or another game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Just to clarify the plot: One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu are defeated by Xibalba, but their sons learn to play ball, go to Xibalba, and defeat the Lords of Xibalba. Afterwords, humans are finally created.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# The Symbolic Interpretation of the Game&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, another way of looking at the game is as a symbol representing the sky. From [*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Besides symbolizing the sun's relative position in the order of its rising and its daily trajectory, Hunahpú and Ixbalamqué, playing alone for a long time on opposite sides of the court, represent the position of the sun and the moon at opposing solstices, just as this continues to be depicted on Chortí altars. All this unmistakably reflects a gradual progress in astronomic and cosmogonic knowledge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Popol Vuh is the only American source to speak of the origin of the ball game and place it in time. Not only does it tell us of the game's ethnological antiquity, it also explains its symbolism. It in fact establishes a parallel between the ball players and the solar gods, which from the angles of the universe — to employ the phraseology of the Chumayel manuscript — meet in the center, in this case in the ball court, where they can convert themselves into two and even four persons with no loss of their theogonic individuality, at once a unity and a multiplicity. During the ball game they wear their resplendent ceremonial gear — that is, they exhibit their insignia as solar deities. Two by two they come from the eastern and western sectors of the cosmos and, meeting in the center, forge themselves into the individuality of Heart of Heaven. This fusion of a number of forms under &quot;one single head,&quot; as the Chortís say, is expressed in the principal rule of the game which is that the players can touch the ball only with their body but never with their heads, feet, or arms; each time this happens a point is given the other team. The continual contact of two or four bodies with a single ball makes clear the monotheistic principle whereby the deity integrates itself through the union of its hypostases. This idea is objectified in the group of ball players unable to use their heads or extremities since the ball — the symbol of the Star or Sun god — is alternatively the head of each. This figure of a single-headed god having many bodies is characteristic of Maya thought. We need only to remember Oxlahun-oc (&quot;it of the thirteen feet&quot;), who is mentioned in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel. The motion of the ball imitates the trajectory of the sun, a figure that the Chortí actors also reproduce in their dramatization of this part of the Popol Vuh. Besides this, the Quiché codex represents the descent of god-Seven from the Center of Heaven to the center of the earth by the solar bird which, coming down from on high, &quot;came to see them play.&quot; As said, in Chortí religious allegory the bird of prey, which is the mask, nahual, or messenger of the deity of Heaven, descends vertically to the center of the earth — like the sun's rays — when the daystar goes through the zenith, symbolizing the descent of divine grace. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This interpretation lends a new interpretation to the text: Xibalba, the &quot;Lords of the subterrene regions&quot; ([*Esotericism*][1]) are in conflict with the lords of the sky (the creators of the world) over power over the living world. The punishment of the Lords of Xibalba (&quot;you... shall no longer be allowed to play ball.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) reflects that Xibalba is restricted to a subteranian sphere, and that the power of death is limited. This may be one of the reasons why the gods can then create humans who &quot;can speak their name.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, we don't know enough to know without a doubt the real symbolism behind the ball game&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The conquistadors deliberately supressed indiginous culture when they conquored central america, and only four written mayan documents remain. It's impossible to understate the destruction that these cultures faced, and we are very fortunate that texts like the Popol Vuh still exist.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I am continuously amazed at the quality of sources on mythology available online. Why would anyone want to read wikipedia?  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This line does not occur in the Christenson translation, but the Lords of Xibalba still faced severe restrictions on their power.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; There is disagreement about the meaning of the ball game.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A good account of the translation can be found [on JStor (behind a paywall)][2]. Another account, which also discusses the cultural destruction of the maya, is located in the preamble of [the online version of Allen J.

One twitch of a (metaphorical) muscle, and **poof** everything is gone. Throughout the Bible, it is clear that there are many, many situations where God does not directly do some work Himself, but rather delegates it to another being. For instance, the Christian church grew from ~120 to 3000+ to 2 billion through the efforts of human evangelism. (Yes, God played a big role, but hardly anyone ever converts to Christianity without being told about it.) Similarly, the devil (also known as Lucifer) and his minions, the demons, attack humans and particularly Jews/Christians, and Michael and the angels fight back. A rather popular misconception among Christians is that God and Satan are equals. This is entirely wrong. *Michael* and Satan are equals. Furthermore, there is additional symbolic meaning to be found in the fact that there is a spiritual war between angels and demons, and I will elaborate on this later.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To directly answer your questions, God *does* command His side in the war, but not directly, and Michael is essentially His second-in-command. So, Michael is the foremost angel of the Heavenly Host, but God is the Commander-in-Chief." />

It was a water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; world inhabited only by animals and creatures of the air who could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; survive without land.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Up above, the Sky World was quite different. Human-type beings lived&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there with infinite types of plants and animals to enjoy.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Sky World, there was a Tree of Life that was very special to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the people of the Sky World. They knew that it grew at the entrance to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the world below and forbade anyone to tamper with the Tree. One woman&#xD;&#xA;&gt; who was soon to give birth was curious about the Tree and convinced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her brother to uproot the Tree.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beneath the Tree was a great hole. The woman peered from the edge into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the hole and suddenly fell off the edge. As she was falling she&#xD;&#xA;&gt; grasped at the edge and clutched in her hand some of the earth from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Sky World. As she fell, the birds of the world below were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; disturbed and alerted to her distress. The birds responded and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; gathered a great many of their kind to break her fall and cradle her&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to the back of a great sea turtle. The creatures of the water believed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that she needed land to live on, so they set about to collect some for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her. They dove to the great depths of the world's oceans to gather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earth to make her a place to live. Many of the animals tried to gather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the earth from the ocean floor, only the muskrat was successful. With&#xD;&#xA;&gt; only a small bit of earth brought onto turtle's back from his small&#xD;&#xA;&gt; paws, Turtle Island began to grow.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Sky Woman soon gave birth to a daughter on Turtle Island. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daughter grew fast. There were no man-beings on Turtle Island, but a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; being known as the West Wind married the daughter of Sky Woman.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Soon the daughter of Sky Woman gave birth to Twins. One was born the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; natural way, and he was called the Right-Handed Twin. The other was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; born in a way that caused the death of the mother. He was called the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Left-Handed Twin. When their mother died, their grandmother, Sky&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Woman, placed the fistful of earth that she grasped from the edge of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Sky World, and placed it on her daughter's grave. The earth&#xD;&#xA;&gt; carried special seeds from the Sky World that were nourished by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earth over her daughter. So from the body of her daughter came the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sacred Tobacco, Strawberry and Sweetgrass. We call these Kionhekwa.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Life Givers.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Right and Left-Handed Twins were endowed with special creative&#xD;&#xA;&gt; powers. The Right-Handed Twin created gentle hills, beautiful smelling&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flowers, quiet brooks, butterflies and numerous creatures, plants and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earth formations. His brother the Left-Handed Twin made snakes, thorns&#xD;&#xA;&gt; on rose bushes, thunder and lightning and other more disturbing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attributes of today's world. Together, they created man and his many&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attributes. The Right-Handed Twin believed in diplomacy and conflict&#xD;&#xA;&gt; resolution. The Left-Handed Twin believed in conflict as resolution.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; They were very different, but all that they created is an integral&#xD;&#xA;&gt; part of this Earth's Creation.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Their Grandmother, Sky Woman, now came to the end of her life. When&#xD;&#xA;&gt; she died, the Twins fought over her body and pulled it apart, throwing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her head into the sky. As part of the Sky World, there her head&#xD;&#xA;&gt; remained to shine upon the world as Grandmother Moon. The Twins could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not live together without fighting. They agreed to dwell in different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; realms of the earth. The Right-Handed Twin continued to live in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daylight and the Left-Handed Twin became a dweller of the night. Both&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of them continue their special duties to their Mother the Earth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this doesn't tell us where the Sky People came from.

Text="To oversimplify it, **God is too powerful**. One twitch of a (metaphorical) muscle, and ***poof*** everything is gone. God created everything, the whole universe, including the dragon (devil/Satan) and demons. Furthermore, He sustains the existence of everything ([Hebrews 1:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Hebrews+1:3&amp;version=NIV&quot;)) , so He has the upper hand in this war, to put it mildly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Throughout the Bible, it is clear that there are many, many situations where God does not directly do some work Himself, but rather delegates it to another being. For instance, the Christian church grew from [~120](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+1%3A15&amp;version=NIV) to [3000+](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=acts+2%3A41&amp;version=NIV) to [2.2 billion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_religious_populations#Adherent_estimates) through the efforts of human evangelism. Yes, of course God was heavily involved, but He still needed/wanted His followers to spread the Gospel ([Romans 10:13-15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+10%3A13-15&amp;version=NIV)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Similarly, angels appear almost exclusively as messengers, worshipers, and/or warriors. The devil, also known as Satan or Lucifer, used to be the best and brightest ([literally](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+14:12&amp;version=NIV)) of the angels. He and the demons especially attack Jews/Christians ([1 Peter 5:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Peter+5%3A8&amp;version=NIV)), and Michael and the angels fight back ([Daniel 10:12-14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+10:12-14&amp;version=NIV)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A rather popular misconception among Christians is that God and Satan are equals. This is entirely wrong. *Michael* and Satan/Lucifer are equals, even brothers. Furthermore, one good way to look at God is as if He was an Author and that this whole universe and all the events that happen are part of one huge, grand Story. In that sense, this struggle between angels and demons is the classic Good vs. Evil battle. If God were to step in and wipe out all the forces of Evil with a single thought, that would be Deus Ex Machina of the highest order, and make for a pretty poor Story. Really, God has *already* won the War with the death and resurrection of His Son Jesus Christ (and the demons never had a chance), but the battles continue for the souls of people, and will continue until God brings the Story to its conclusion (the first chapter anyway).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To directly answer your questions, God *does* command His side in the war, but as Commander-in-Chief and does not get directly, personally involved in the battles. Michael is essentially His second-in-command and the foremost angel of the Heavenly Host." />

The details vary, but certainly after Geoffrey of Monmouth, it's generally agreed that Mordred was responsible for Arthur's downfall - Arthur killed Mordred, but was mortally wounded in the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**c. 1136:** [The original account][1] in Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Historia Regum Brittaniae*, the generally accepted first appearance of Arthur, in which he refers to Mordred as Modred, says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [In Cornwall] Modred, as he was the boldest of men, and always the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; quickest at making an attack, immediately placed his troops in order,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; resolving either to conquer or to die, rather than continue his flight&#xD;&#xA;&gt; any longer. [...] It would be both grievous and tedious to relate the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; slaughter, the cruel havoc, and the excess of fury that was to be seen&#xD;&#xA;&gt; on both sides. In this manner they spent a good part of the day, till&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Arthur at last made a push with his company, consisting of six&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thousand six hundred and sixty-six men, against that in which he knew&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Modred was; and having opened a way with their swords, they pierced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; quite through it, and made a grievous slaughter. For in this assault&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fell the wicked traitor himself, and many thousands with him. [...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And even the renowned king Arthur himself was mortally wounded; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; being carried thence to the isle of Avallon to be cured of his wounds,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; he gave up the crown of Britain to his kinsman Constantine, the son of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cador, duke of Cornwall, in the five hundred and forty-second year of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; our Lord's incarnation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**c. 1155:** Wace's *[Roman de Brut][2]* (translation by Eugene Mason) says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Arthur was sick with wrath that he was not avenged of Mordred. He had&#xD;&#xA;&gt; neither peace nor rest whilst the traitor abode in his land. Arthur&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learned of Mordred’s strength in Cornwall, and this was grievous to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; him. [...] Arthur sent after his men to the very Humber. He gathered&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to himself so mighty a host that it was as the sand for multitude.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With this he sought Mordred where he knew he could be found. He&#xD;&#xA;&gt; purposed to slay and make an end of the traitor and his perjury alike.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mordred had no desire to shrink from battle. He preferred to stake all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; on the cast, yea, though the throw meant death—rather than be harried&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from place to place. The battle was arrayed on the Camel, over against&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the entrance to Cornwall. [...] There, too, was Mordred slain in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; press, together with the greater part of his folk; and in the selfsame&#xD;&#xA;&gt; day were destroyed the flower of Arthur’s host, the best and hardiest&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of his men. So the chronicle speaks sooth, Arthur himself was wounded&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in his body to the death. He caused him to be borne to Avalon for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; searching of his hurts. [...] Arthur bade that he should be carried to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Avalon in this hope in the year 642 of the Incarnation. The sorer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sorrow that he was a childless man. To Constantine, Cador’s son, Earl&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of Cornwall, and his near kin, Arthur committed the realm, commanding&#xD;&#xA;&gt; him to hold it as king until he returned to his own. The earl took the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; land to his keeping. He held it as bidden, but nevertheless Arthur&#xD;&#xA;&gt; came never again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**c. 1400:** In the *[Alliterative Morte Arthure][4]* (because who needs prose when you can have it in stanzas?!):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He hit Mordred amid the breste&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And out at the backe bone him bore;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; There hath Mordred his life lost,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; That speche spake he never more;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then keenly up his arm he cast&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And gave Arthur a wounde sore,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Into the hede through the helm and crest,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; That three times he swooned there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1485:** Thomas Mallory, in his famous *[Le Morte d'Arthur][3]* (Helen Cooper, Oxford World Classics version), in Book VIII: The Death of Arthur, says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And when Sir Mordred saw King Arthur, he ran unto him with his sword&#xD;&#xA;&gt; drawn in his hand; and there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shield with a foin of his spear, throughout the body, more than a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fathom. And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his death’s wound, he&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thrust himself with the might that he had up to the bur* of King&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Arthur’s spear; and right so he smote his father, King Arthur, with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; his sword holding in both his hands, upon the side of the head, that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the sword pierced the helmet and the tay* of the brain. And there-with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mordred dashed down stark dead to the earth. And noble King Arthur&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned oftentimes.[...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ‘Comfort thyself,’ said the King, ‘and do as well as thou mayest, for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in me is no trust for to trust in. For I will into the vale of Avilion&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to heal me of my grievous wound; and if thou hear never more of me,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pray for my soul.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/geoffrey-of-monmouth-arthurian-passages-from-the-history-of-the-kings-of-britain&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/wace_mason.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur#Book_VIII:_.E2.80.9CThe_Death_of_Arthur.E2.80.9D_.28Caxton_XX.E2.80.93XXI.29&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/benson-and-foster-king-arthurs-death-stanzaic-morte-arthur-part-iii" />

The details vary, but certainly after Geoffrey of Monmouth, it's generally agreed that Mordred was responsible for Arthur's downfall - Arthur killed Mordred, but was mortally wounded in the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**c. 1136:** [The original account][1] in Geoffrey of Monmouth's *Historia Regum Brittaniae*, the generally accepted first appearance of Arthur, in which he refers to Mordred as Modred, says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [In Cornwall] Modred, as he was the boldest of men, and always the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; quickest at making an attack, immediately placed his troops in order,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; resolving either to conquer or to die, rather than continue his flight&#xD;&#xA;&gt; any longer. [...] It would be both grievous and tedious to relate the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; slaughter, the cruel havoc, and the excess of fury that was to be seen&#xD;&#xA;&gt; on both sides. In this manner they spent a good part of the day, till&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Arthur at last made a push with his company, consisting of six&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thousand six hundred and sixty-six men, against that in which he knew&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Modred was; and having opened a way with their swords, they pierced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; quite through it, and made a grievous slaughter. For in this assault&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fell the wicked traitor himself, and many thousands with him. [...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And even the renowned king Arthur himself was mortally wounded; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; being carried thence to the isle of Avallon to be cured of his wounds,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; he gave up the crown of Britain to his kinsman Constantine, the son of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Cador, duke of Cornwall, in the five hundred and forty-second year of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; our Lord's incarnation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**c. 1155:** Wace's *[Roman de Brut][2]* (translation by Eugene Mason) says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Arthur was sick with wrath that he was not avenged of Mordred. He had&#xD;&#xA;&gt; neither peace nor rest whilst the traitor abode in his land. Arthur&#xD;&#xA;&gt; learned of Mordred’s strength in Cornwall, and this was grievous to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; him. [...] Arthur sent after his men to the very Humber. He gathered&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to himself so mighty a host that it was as the sand for multitude.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With this he sought Mordred where he knew he could be found. He&#xD;&#xA;&gt; purposed to slay and make an end of the traitor and his perjury alike.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mordred had no desire to shrink from battle. He preferred to stake all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; on the cast, yea, though the throw meant death—rather than be harried&#xD;&#xA;&gt; from place to place. The battle was arrayed on the Camel, over against&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the entrance to Cornwall. [...] There, too, was Mordred slain in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; press, together with the greater part of his folk; and in the selfsame&#xD;&#xA;&gt; day were destroyed the flower of Arthur’s host, the best and hardiest&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of his men. So the chronicle speaks sooth, Arthur himself was wounded&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in his body to the death. He caused him to be borne to Avalon for the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; searching of his hurts. [...] Arthur bade that he should be carried to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Avalon in this hope in the year 642 of the Incarnation. The sorer&#xD;&#xA;&gt; sorrow that he was a childless man. To Constantine, Cador’s son, Earl&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of Cornwall, and his near kin, Arthur committed the realm, commanding&#xD;&#xA;&gt; him to hold it as king until he returned to his own. The earl took the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; land to his keeping. He held it as bidden, but nevertheless Arthur&#xD;&#xA;&gt; came never again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**c. 1400:** In the *[Alliterative Morte Arthure][4]* (because who needs prose when you can have it in stanzas?):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He hit Mordred amid the breste&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And out at the backe bone him bore;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; There hath Mordred his life lost,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; That speche spake he never more;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then keenly up his arm he cast&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And gave Arthur a wounde sore,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Into the hede through the helm and crest,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; That three times he swooned there.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wider context in *Alliterative Morte Arthure*:** I've found references stating that Mordred attached Arthur in disguise in this version, but that Arthur recognised him because he was using Arthur's other sword (not Excalibur), Clarent. However, I need to read the orignal text more carefully to verify this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1485:** Thomas Mallory, in his famous *[Le Morte d'Arthur][3]* (Helen Cooper, Oxford World Classics version), in Book VIII: The Death of Arthur, says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And when Sir Mordred saw King Arthur, he ran unto him with his sword&#xD;&#xA;&gt; drawn in his hand; and there King Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shield with a foin of his spear, throughout the body, more than a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fathom. And when Sir Mordred felt that he had his death’s wound, he&#xD;&#xA;&gt; thrust himself with the might that he had up to the bur* of King&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Arthur’s spear; and right so he smote his father, King Arthur, with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; his sword holding in both his hands, upon the side of the head, that&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the sword pierced the helmet and the tay* of the brain. And there-with&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mordred dashed down stark dead to the earth. And noble King Arthur&#xD;&#xA;&gt; fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned oftentimes.[...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ‘Comfort thyself,’ said the King, ‘and do as well as thou mayest, for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in me is no trust for to trust in. For I will into the vale of Avilion&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to heal me of my grievous wound; and if thou hear never more of me,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; pray for my soul.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Wider context in *Le Morte d'Arthur*:** Sir Gawain has been slain in a recent battle with Mordred's forces. Later, he comes to Arthur in a dream and warns him not to battle with Mordred. Arthur asks for a truce, and the two armies meet to discuss this, but after a snake appears, a knight draws a sword to kill it. This is taken as a symbol of aggression, and the &quot;final battle&quot; starts. After Arthur is mortally wounded, he gives his sword, Excalibur, to Sir Bedivere to throw in a lake. After Sir Bedivere finally complies, a hand rises from the water to catch the sword.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/text/geoffrey-of-monmouth-arthurian-passages-from-the-history-of-the-kings-of-britain&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.yorku.ca/inpar/wace_mason.pdf&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Morte_d%27Arthur#Book_VIII:_.E2.80.9CThe_Death_of_Arthur.E2.80.9D_.28Caxton_XX.E2.80.93XXI.29&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/benson-and-foster-king-arthurs-death-stanzaic-morte-arthur-part-iii" />

The best first source I can find is a book called [Myths and Legends of the New York State Iroquois, by Harriet Maxwell Converse, 1908](http://goo.gl/e4v496). It's about as good of a first source as there's going to be, since Iroquois stories were transmitted from generation to generation orally, and other people like Ms. Converse had to be the ones to write them down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, it seems that the father of the Sky Woman is known by many names, including **Sho-gwa-yah-dit-sat-oh** (He Who Created Us), **Ha-wen-ni-yu** (He Who Governs), **Hah-ni-go-e-yoo** (Good Mind), and **To-no-do-oo** (Great Spirit). He seems to have been a sort of monotheistic, omnipotent being who then created the earth and all the other gods:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; By Iroquois mythology, the earth was the thought of the Indian Ruler of a great island which floats in space. In all of the Iroquois myths, the natural and the supernatural are so closely bonded that they seem one realm. Yet in the story of the creation, the Ruler bestowed universal authority upon the two spirits, Good and Evil, who remain on earth always.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It goes on to tell the story you have in your question and the names of the Great Ruler that I wrote above.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, the best answer I give is that to ask this question is akin to asking a Jew/Christian &quot;where did God (the Father) come from&quot; or an ancient Greek where the Chaos came from. There is no answer besides &quot;He was always there.&quot;" />

So that it might not go unpunished, she changed the Gorgon’s hair to foul snakes. And now, to terrify her enemies, numbing them with fear, the goddess wears the snakes, that she created, as a breastplate.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because Ovid (that translation anyway) says &quot;terrify&quot; and not &quot;turn to stone&quot;, it would suggest that **Athena didn't actually wear the entire head in her armor**, just the snakes; which perhaps on their own didn't turn anyone to stone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it was certainly not because Medusa could not turn gods to stone; Perseus turned [Atlas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)), a Titan, to stone:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Perseus delaying resolutely, and combining that with calm words. Inferior in strength (who could equal Atlas in strength?), he said, ‘Well now, since you show me so little kindness, accept a gift’ and turning away himself, he held out Medusa’s foul head, on his left hand side. Atlas became a mountain, as huge as he himself had been. Now his hair and beard were changed into trees, his shoulders and hands into ridges. What had been his head before was the crest on the mountain summit. His bones became stones. Then he grew to an immense height in every part (so you gods determined) and the whole sky, with its many stars, rested on him." />

They are:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Hesiod, Theogony, 276](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:abo:tlg,0020,001:276)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; Gorgons who dwell beyond glorious Ocean in the frontier land towards Night where are the clear-voiced Hesperides, Sthenno, and Euryale, and Medusa who suffered a woeful fate: she was mortal, but the two were undying and grew not old. With her lay the Dark-haired One in a soft meadow amid spring flowers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Pseudo-Apollodorus, Library, 2.4.2](http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus2.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; ...he flew to the ocean and caught the Gorgons asleep. They were Stheno, Euryale, and Medusa. Now Medusa alone was mortal; for that reason Perseus was sent to fetch her head.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Neither of these offers any explanation of the phenomenon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Possible explanations:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Athena's punishment - While both of the quotes sources refer to Medusa having offspring with Poseidon, the first mention I can find of Athena's (more accurately Minerva's) punishment is [Ovid's Metamorphosies, Book 4](http://ovid.lib.virginia.edu/trans/Metamorph4.htm#478205208), in response to the question of &quot;...why Medusa, alone among her sisters, had snakes twining in her hair.&quot;  Which is somewhat difficult to reconcile with the quoted Apollodorus myth, in which all three are described as similarly monstrous:&#xD;&#xA; &gt; But the Gorgons had heads twined about with the scales of dragons, and great tusks like swine's, and brazen hands, and golden wings, by which they flew; and they turned to stone such as beheld them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Perhaps it just works out that way sometimes.   Looking at the offspring of Phorcys and Ceto, some few of them appear to have been killed.  In one version of the story, Ladon was killed by Heracles, in pursuit of the Apples of the Hesperides (his 11th labor).  Echidna was killed by Argus Panoptes, as related in pseudo-Apollodorus Library.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    The idea that, by some chance of fate, she was born mortal seems more in line with my impression from the phrasing used in translations of Hesiod, with phrases like &quot;suffered a woeful fate&quot; or &quot;suffered grievously&quot;, in the two translation I've seen.  That turn of phrase seems interesting to me.  Analysis of the original text might be valuable here, but I am unequipped to provide it." />

Thor, who had lost the hammer that he had sworn never to let out of his sight, did not know what to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;But Loki thought it would be worth while to see if Thrym knew anything about it.

It is below the caves of the Dwarfs.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the feast, where Thor and Loki are disguised, the Hammer is presented to `Thor`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Then Thrym, the stupidest of the Giants, rose up and brought Miölnir, the defence of Asgard, into the feasting hall. Thor could hardly restrain himself from springing up and seizing it from the Giant. But Loki was able to keep him still. Thrym brought over the hammer and put the handle into the hands of her whom he thought was his bride. Thor's hands closed on his hammer. Instantly he stood up. The veil fell off him. His countenance and his blazing eyes were seen by all. He struck one blow on the wall of the house. Down it crashed. Then Thor went striding out of the ruin with Loki beside him, while within the Giants bellowed as the roof and walls fell down on them.

The number of these worlds is stated as five, seven, or nine. These worlds are arranged symmetrically above and below the earth, each of the lower worlds having a corresponding one above it.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; All these worlds, as said before, are joined by holes situated under the Polar Star. Shamans and spirits while going from one world to another slip through these holes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And earlier, while describing the star itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The most important is the Polar Star, which is called in the Chukchee language Ilu'kalin e'nier or Ilu'k-e'iner (&quot;motionless star&quot;), or Aglqe'p- e'ner (&quot;nail star&quot;), or Unp-e'nier (&quot;the pole-stuck star&quot;). This latter name occurs throughout Asia. It suggests the existence of a simile in which all other stars move around the Polar Star as horses or reindeer move around a pole to which they are tethered. The house of the Polar Star stands in the zenith. Directly under it is a hole through which it is possible to pass from one world to another. Through a series of these holes the Polar Star can be seen in al the lower and higher worlds, while the other constellations change with the diferent worlds. Carrying this idea further, the house of the Polar Star is supposed to be higher than that of any other star. Itis made of a material similar to ice, and on the top of it is set the beacon- lamp of the star.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Chukchi being a people living in the arctic Siberia, one would indeed expect the North Star to be central to their cosmogony.

The number of these worlds is stated as five, seven, or nine. These worlds are arranged symmetrically above and below the earth, each of the lower worlds having a corresponding one above it.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [...]&#xD;&#xA;&gt; All these worlds, as said before, are joined by holes situated under the Polar Star. Shamans and spirits while going from one world to another slip through these holes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And earlier, while describing the star itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The most important is the Polar Star, which is called in the Chukchee language Ilu'kalin e'nier or Ilu'k-e'iner (&quot;motionless star&quot;), or Aglqe'p- e'ner (&quot;nail star&quot;), or Unp-e'nier (&quot;the pole-stuck star&quot;). This latter name occurs throughout Asia. It suggests the existence of a simile in which all other stars move around the Polar Star as horses or reindeer move around a pole to which they are tethered. The house of the Polar Star stands in the zenith. Directly under it is a hole through which it is possible to pass from one world to another. Through a series of these holes the Polar Star can be seen in al the lower and higher worlds, while the other constellations change with the diferent worlds. Carrying this idea further, the house of the Polar Star is supposed to be higher than that of any other star. It is made of a material similar to ice, and on the top of it is set the beacon - lamp of the star.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Chukchi being a people living in the arctic Siberia, one would indeed expect the North Star to be central to their cosmogony.

Usually, it's never argued why it is such an important number, but it's present in many holy texts, accompanying important figures. Since the quote in the question is mine, I'd like to insist that there is not clear evidence as to why it is an important number from a religious aspect. Yes, once can judge from the multiple occurrences that it is an important number, but the mythological texts never go into details as to why it is so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's usually explained in a mathematical essence. The number `10` is quite important nowadays due to the use of the `decimal` system. Since the use of the [Duodecimal][1] and [Sexagesimal][2] systems was widespread at the time, 12 was considered to have an important meaning on a mathematical aspect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, it is wrong to treat the number `12` as... `12`.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* 10 in the duodecimal system&#xD;&#xA;* C in the hexadecimal system&#xD;&#xA;* 1100 in the binary system and so on.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and so on.

Lycaon, the king of Arcadia, had sacrificed a boy to Zeus, who was appalled by this savage offering. Zeus unleashed a deluge, so that the rivers ran in torrents and the sea flooded the coastal plain, engulfed the foothills with spray, and washed everything clean. Deucalion, with the aid of his father Prometheus, was saved from this deluge by building a chest.[2] Like the Biblical Noah and the Mesopotamian counterpart Utnapishtim, he uses his device to survive the deluge with his wife, Pyrrha.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; ....&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Once the deluge was over and the couple had given thanks to Zeus, Deucalion (said in several of the sources to have been aged 82 at the time) consulted an oracle of Themis about how to repopulate the earth. He was told to cover your head and throw the bones of your mother behind your shoulder. Deucalion and Pyrrha understood that &quot;mother&quot; is Gaia, the mother of all living things, and the &quot;bones&quot; to be rocks. They threw the rocks behind their shoulders and the stones formed people. Pyrrha's became women; Deucalion's became men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Deucalion and Pyrrha had at least two children, Hellen and Protogenea, and possibly a third, Amphictyon (who is autochthonous in other traditions).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deucalion" />

Yes, once can judge from the multiple occurrences that it is an important number, but the mythological texts never go into details as to why it is so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's usually explained in a mathematical essence. The number `10` is quite important nowadays due to the use of the `decimal` system.

Firstly, black-winged Nyx (Night) laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebos (Darkness), and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros (Love) with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartaros (Hell-Pit) with dark Khaos (Air), winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race [the birds], which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Ouranos (Heaven), Okeanos (Ocean), Ge (Earth) and the imperishable race of blessed gods (Theoi) sprang into being.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -- Aristophanes, Birds 685&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, Gaea is understood to be a personification of the Earth; the same goes for Chaos, Erebus/Erebos, Eros, and many of the others." />

For there is a structure of stones there, which none of this age could raise, wthout a profound knowledge of the mechanical arts. They are stones of a vast magnitude and wonderful quality; and if they can be placed here, as they are there, round this spot of ground, they will stand forever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This was an idea which gained popularity alongside much of Monmouth's writings. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Aurelius ordered Merlin to erect round the burial-place the stones which he had brought from Ireland.

In fact, of all the Greek pantheon, Zeus is the most obviously descended from a prehistorical deity common to the [Proto-Indo-European peoples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-Europeans). Under the prevailing consensus, therefore, Zeus is not a deified [Cretan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete) king.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The same root for 'shine' furnished the name of the head of the PIE pantheon, a god called Father Sky, whose name is securely reconstructible from the exact equation of Vedic Sanskrit *dyàuṣ pítar* '(o) Father Sky', Greek *Zeu pater* '(o) Father Zeus', and the Latin *Iū-piter* 'Jupiter' (Literlaly 'father Jove', also originally a vocative or form of direct address like the previous two.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Fortson, B. *[Indo-European Language and Culture: an Introduction.](http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405188960.html)* Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, 2004.&lt;/sub&gt;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;More generally, [Euhemerus'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euhemerus) theory on the origin of myths has one essential flaw. There is typically no evidence to support historical explanations for mythical events or figures. In the case of Zeus, the evidence that he dates back to the time of Proto-Indo-Europeans makes the theory that he was a (relatively) more recent Cretan king quite unlikely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Euhemerus' theory has one basic weakness. In most cases, modern scholars lack enough historical evidence to determine whether a mythical figure ever existed. &#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Jacobs, Dale W.

A Jotun is a giant with superhuman strength; their homeland is Jotunheim. Ægir is said to be the sea jotun. And from the above quote, it is clear that Ægir was a giant. Hence confirming that the terms jotun and giants are very same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In modern Icelandic, *jötunn* has kept its original meaning. In Old English, the cognate to ***jötunn*** is ***eoten***, whence modern English ***ettin***. Hence ettin is *another* term for giants, which evolved from the ancient roots of its original term.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;This extract from the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál, suggest that trolls were opposites to the giants (emphasis mine).&#xD;&#xA;&gt;They call me a troll,&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    moon of the earth-Hrungnir &lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    **wealth sucker of the giant**,&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    destroyer of the storm-sun &lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    beloved follower of the seeress,&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The giants were often involved in incidents of higher degree (eg. battles with gods) whereas trolls live isolated and are not involved (not as much of the giants) with the higher degree incidents.

Inferior in strength (who could equal Atlas in strength?), he said, ‘Well now, since you show me so little kindness, accept a gift’ and turning away himself, he held out Medusa’s foul head, on his left hand side. Atlas became a mountain, as huge as he himself had been. Now his hair and beard were changed into trees, his shoulders and hands into ridges. What had been his head before was the crest on the mountain summit. His bones became stones. Then he grew to an immense height in every part (so you gods determined) and the whole sky, with its many stars, rested on him." />

There were four major cities, each with their own stories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The [egg creation myth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad#In_Egyptian_mythology) is that of the city of [Hermopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermopolis), that you've already cited above. **Ogdoad** is the name of the 8 divine entities of that city's faith.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. [Heliopolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient)) had [a different interpretation](http://books.google.com/books?id=6KUdBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=creation#v=snippet&amp;q=creation&amp;f=false):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; The actual process of creation was the interest of theologians in another great Egyptian city, Heliopolis (near the site of modern Cairo). Egyptian creation accounts do not seem to have envisaged the possibility of something being created from nothing. Instead, they describe how everything in the world-all its elements and forces-came from a single source, much like the primordial singularity in the &quot;Big Bang&quot; theory of modern physics. This original source of all things was known as the god Atum. The god's name means &quot;finisher,&quot; and refers to the fact that Atum &quot;finished up&quot; as the world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; &amp;lt;snip&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; The birth of the sun is actually the cumlination of creation in the Heliopolitan system, as it is in the early myth of the primeval mound. The sun's first rising into the newly created world-space marks the end of creation and the beginning of the eternal cycle of life, which the sun regulates (as king of nature) and makes possible through his heat and light. The Heliopolitan accounts therefore concentrate not only on Atum's &quot;evolution&quot; but also on the sun's role in the creation. An element of nature, the sun is known simply as &quot;Sun&quot; (usually trascribed &quot;Re&quot; or &quot;Ra&quot;). As the newly risen &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. [Memphis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memphis,_Egypt) had [yet another interpretation](http://books.google.com/books?id=6KUdBAAAQBAJ&amp;q=creation#v=onepage&amp;q=ptah&amp;f=false) which is very similar to that of Heliopolis, except that **Ptah** served as the intermediary through which Atum's will was given form:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; But much older is Ptah, who enlivened all the gods as well as their life-forces through this heart and through this tongue ... His Ennead is in his presence in teeth and lips, which are the seed and hands of Atum: for Atum's Ennead evolved form his seed and his fingers, but the Ennead is teeth and lips in this mouth that pronounced the identity of everything and through which Shu and Tefnut emerged and gave bearth to the Ennead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. [Thebes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebes,_Egypt) is the city that believed in Amun [taking the form of an animal, e.g. a goose or a serpent](https://books.google.com/books?id=0H3v0nPk1V4C&amp;q=thebes#v=snippet&amp;q=thebes&amp;f=false). I don't have a reference for the creation of Ra, but I assume it goes hand-in-hand with the creation of the world:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; The Thebans did not reject the Ogdoad altogether, but placed Amun as its sole creator: he was the &quot;First One Who Gave Birth to the First Ones.&quot; One version of the myth depicts him as a serpent, Amun-Khamutef (&quot;He Who Has Completed his Moment&quot;), living in the waters of Nun. However, it is suggested elsewhere that he emitted a mighty honk, like a goose, which burst into the stillness of the universe, causing a cosmic reaction by which the Ogdoad and the Ennead were formed.&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; The Thebans developed a distinct theology in which Amun was concealed even from the gods, existing somewhere beyond the natural world. It was thought that a creator had to stand apart from his creation, and Amun, the &quot;hidden&quot; god, suited this role. The texts summarized Amun's mystery and power:&#xD;&#xA;  &gt; &gt; &quot;He is hidden from the gods, and his aspect is unknown. He is farther than the sky, he is deeper than the Duat. No god knows his true appearance ... no one testifies to him accurately. He is too secret to uncover his awesomeness, he is too great to investigate, too powerful to know. Manifest one, whose identity is hidden ... as it is inaccessible.&quot;" />

It explains that the Rainbow Serpent may have been inspired by one or more of the following Australian snakes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The rough-scaled python&#xD;&#xA; - The taipan&#xD;&#xA; - The file snake&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These snakes could inspire cultures across the continent. Research tells me that the rough-scaled python is active in a small area of [Western Australia](http://www.arod.com.au/arod/reptilia/Squamata/Pythonidae/Morelia/carinata), though its range may be much larger. The taipan lives [in central Australia](http://inlandtaipan.weebly.com/habitat.html) as well as [the coast](http://www.ozanimals.com/Reptile/Coastal-Taipan/Oxyuranus/scutellatus%20.html) and [regions beyond](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580808/taipan). File snakes live in [aquatic areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrochordidae) [across the region](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1563896?uid=3739808&amp;uid=391386151&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21106716459113). An extinct snake, *Wonambia*, would also have lived [in the plains](http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/predinosaurreptiles/p/Wonambi.htm); [other large species](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/w/wonambi.html) existed. Given the geographic spread of these snakes, they all could have inspired cultures across Australia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I independently found [one of the Wikipedia sources](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/rainbow-serpent/?ar_a=1), which supports the conclusions (of course!), as well as [a related document](http://media.education.nationalgeographic.com:8080/assets/reference/assets/rainbow-serpent-1.pdf). [This](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/saving-the-rainbow-serpent/6407852) is the only other non-National Geographic source I could find. The evidence, though, stacks up to give a sensible conclusion: Snakes were everywhere in Australia, so they provided a common habitat component. And the big ones sure seemed powerful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[A related page.](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/climate_culture/rainbow_serp.shtml)&lt;/sup&gt;" />

With Galahad's death, the Grail vanished.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; With the disappearance of the Grail from Britain, it also meant the withdrawal of God's grace from Britain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems quite odd that the Holy Grail, one of the most sacred relics in Arthurian literature, should disappear for all eternity and never re-appear. Does the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle) discuss a possible return of the Holy Grail to Britain - or anywhere else, for that matter?" />

It explains that the Rainbow Serpent may have been inspired by one or more of the following Australian snakes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The rough-scaled python&#xD;&#xA; - The taipan&#xD;&#xA; - The file snake&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These snakes could inspire cultures across the continent. Research tells me that the rough-scaled python is active in a small area of [Western Australia](http://www.arod.com.au/arod/reptilia/Squamata/Pythonidae/Morelia/carinata), though its range may be much larger. The taipan lives [in central Australia](http://inlandtaipan.weebly.com/habitat.html) as well as [the coast](http://www.ozanimals.com/Reptile/Coastal-Taipan/Oxyuranus/scutellatus%20.html) and [regions beyond](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580808/taipan). File snakes live in [aquatic areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrochordidae) [across the region](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1563896?uid=3739808&amp;uid=391386151&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21106716459113). An extinct snake, *Wonambia*, would also have lived [in the plains](http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/predinosaurreptiles/p/Wonambi.htm); [other large species](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/w/wonambi.html) existed. Given the geographic spread of these snakes, they all could have inspired cultures across Australia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I independently found [one of the Wikipedia sources](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/rainbow-serpent/?ar_a=1), which supports the conclusions (of course!), as well as [a related document](http://media.education.nationalgeographic.com:8080/assets/reference/assets/rainbow-serpent-1.pdf). [This](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/saving-the-rainbow-serpent/6407852) is the only other non-National Geographic source I could find. The evidence, though, stacks up to give a sensible conclusion: Snakes were everywhere in Australia, so they provided a common habitat component. And the big ones sure seemed powerful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One issue with this hypothesis is that some of the snakes have small geographic distributions - just look at the range of the rough-scaled python! There are other species of snakes in Australia, so they could make up the difference, but the limits of the three given snakes are a tad worrisome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[A related page.](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/climate_culture/rainbow_serp.shtml)&lt;/sup&gt;" />

He wrote that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the year 8 Tochtli, which was 1,347 years after the second calamity and 4,779 years since the creation of the world, it is recorded in their history that **the sun stood still one natural day without moving**, and a myth evolved wherein a mosquito saw the sun suspended in the air in a pensive mood and said, &quot;Lord of the world, why are you standing still and why are you in such deep thought? Why are you not doing the work you are supposed to do? Do you want to destroy the world as before?&quot; And the mosquito said many other things to the sun, but the sun still did not move. The mosquito then stung the sun on the leg, and seeing that his leg had been stung, the sun began again to move along its course as before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is clearly the same story described in your link.

" Text="First, I took a look at [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Serpent#Possible_origins_in_nature). It explains that the Rainbow Serpent may have been inspired by one or more of the following Australian snakes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The rough-scaled python&#xD;&#xA; - The taipan&#xD;&#xA; - The file snake&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These snakes could inspire cultures across the continent. Research tells me that the rough-scaled python is active in a small area of [Western Australia](http://www.arod.com.au/arod/reptilia/Squamata/Pythonidae/Morelia/carinata), though its range may be much larger. The taipan lives [in central Australia](http://inlandtaipan.weebly.com/habitat.html) as well as [the coast](http://www.ozanimals.com/Reptile/Coastal-Taipan/Oxyuranus/scutellatus%20.html) and [regions beyond](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/580808/taipan). File snakes live in [aquatic areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrochordidae) [across the region](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1563896?uid=3739808&amp;uid=391386151&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=60&amp;sid=21106716459113). An extinct snake, *Wonambia*, would also have lived [in the plains](http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/predinosaurreptiles/p/Wonambi.htm); [other large species](http://www.prehistoric-wildlife.com/species/w/wonambi.html) existed. Given the geographic spread of these snakes, they all could have inspired cultures across Australia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I independently found [one of the Wikipedia sources](http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/media/rainbow-serpent/?ar_a=1), which supports the conclusions (of course!), as well as [a related document](http://media.education.nationalgeographic.com:8080/assets/reference/assets/rainbow-serpent-1.pdf). [This](http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/saving-the-rainbow-serpent/6407852) is the only other non-National Geographic source I could find. The evidence, though, stacks up to give a sensible conclusion: Snakes were everywhere in Australia, so they provided a common habitat component. And the big ones sure seemed powerful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One issue with this hypothesis is that some of the snakes have small geographic distributions - just look at the range of the rough-scaled python! There are other species of snakes in Australia, so they could make up the difference, but the limits of the three given snakes are a tad worrisome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;[A related page.](http://www.bom.gov.au/iwk/climate_culture/rainbow_serp.shtml)&lt;/sup&gt;" />

And they lived like gods without sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil and grief: miserable age rested not on them; but with legs and arms never failing they made merry with feasting beyond the reach of all evils. When they died, it was as though they were overcome with sleep, and they had all good things; for the fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with many good things, rich in flocks and loved by the blessed gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 121-139) But after earth had covered this generation -- they are called pure spirits dwelling on the earth, and are kindly, delivering from harm, and guardians of mortal men; for they roam everywhere over the earth, clothed in mist and keep watch on judgements and cruel deeds, givers of wealth; for this royal right also they received; -- then they who dwell on Olympus made a second generation which was of silver and less noble by far. It was like the golden race neither in body nor in spirit. A child was brought up at his good mother's side an hundred years, an utter simpleton, playing childishly in his own home. But when they were full grown and were come to the full measure of their prime, they lived only a little time in sorrow because of their foolishness, for they could not keep from sinning and from wronging one another, nor would they serve the immortals, nor sacrifice on the holy altars of the blessed ones as it is right for men to do wherever they dwell.

It is said that after reaching this chakra kundalini dosen't goes down or one does not degrades (spritually) that's why lord Rama is taken as ideal human or god.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dark Blue color of lord Krishna Depicts the milan of Shiva and Hari it means the Sandhya Kal (Evening Time) where day meets night (day-shiva night-hari(dark blue)). Also Narayana's core character is regarded as Krishna that's why he is depicted Dark Blue same as narayana.The Anjana Chakra (Third-Eye) has same color as lord Krishna (see [this][2] for more info)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; अतुलितबलधामं हेमशैलाभदेहं &lt;br&gt; दनुजवनकृशानुं ज्ञानिनामग्रगण्यम् ।&lt;br&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; सकलगुणनिधानं वानराणामधीशं&lt;br&gt; रघुपतिप्रियभक्तं वातात्मजं नमामि ॥&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Mantra Reference][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This mantra from SunderKand of Ramayana depicts Characteristics of lord Hanuman.

Back then, the subsequent bak’tun number was re-set as 1 (1.0.0.0.0) and thereafter their count progressed forward until the reappearance of 13 bak’tuns on December 21 of this year. This repetition of 13s has led some to suppose that a similar re-set of the bak’tun system is upon us now, and that we are destined to go back to 1.0.0.0.0 in some 400 years from now. This is not true. Based on texts from Palenque that project calendar stations far into the future, we know there will be a linear sequence of bak’tuns from here on, represented as 14.0.0.0.0, 15.0.0.0.0, and so on. This will run forward still until 19.0.0.0.0, about 2,400 years from now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Notice that at the end of this roughly 13,000-year span that the bak’tun changes to 0 and the next higher period, the piktun, turns over as 1. As it happens, the piktun unit before this date was set at 13, although this is left unwritten in the dates above. (Mayanists have long tended to just write five numbers of the Long Count, following the convention of the ancient Maya scribes themselves. But we know that this is a truncated representation, and that there were many more cycles above bak’tun and piktun. The full system I call the “Grand Long Count” encompassed 24 units!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, yeah, nothing. From [this NPR article](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2012/12/20/167626648/maya-expert-the-end-of-times-is-our-idea-not-the-ancients), Stuart also said:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;It's a big deal — if you're an ancient Maya astronomer priest,&quot; Stuart says. &quot;But apart from that, they didn't say anything about ... what will be happening.&quot;" />

While hunting, he meets Arawn, king of Annwfn, who strikes a deal with him: The two will switch places for a year. At the end of the year, Pwyll will battle - and kill Hafgan, the other king of Annwfn, in Arawn's stead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both Arawn and Hafgan seem to posses magical powers - as evidenced by Arawn's hunting dogs and his ability to cast enchantments to change a person's appearance - while it does not seem that Pwyll had any special powers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the footnotes, an explanation for Pwynn's victory is given:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We see here that, rather like the Gawain, Pwyll is able to defeat the Annuvian king by following a prescribed form of behaviour, one that in many ways might seem somewhat counter-intuitive. The denouement of this act, as it were, is Pwyll's refusal to finish what he started and give Hafgan the mortal blow. The underlying implication of this act is that had Pwyll given in to his enemy's entreaty, he would have somehow failed to defeat him. Here, the natural laws of the Otherworld seem diametrically opposed to those of the mortal world, where destroying an enemy in this way would have been simple common sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that Hafgan would (seemingly) have had the advantage over Pwyll, why did Arawn choose to swap? Wouldn't he have known of the rules of the Otherworld (Annwfn), given that he was one of its kings, and been able to use that to kill Hafgan?" />

What happens to all of us? The obvious candidate is: growing up. [Glen C. Strathy explains it quite well here](http://www.how-to-write-a-book-now.com/monomyth.html):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It's also the formula for a rite of initiation, which may be why the monomyth is so popular among young adults. It echoes the process all teenagers go through as as they transform from children into adults. Seen from this perspective, the three stages might be described as ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. As the young teen leaves childhood, he/she moves towards greater independence from parents.&#xD;&#xA;2. Adolescence and the struggle to become an adult (to come to terms with adult power, shoulder adult responsibilities, become sexually active, achieve a new understanding of one's parents, find one's place in the world, etc.).&#xD;&#xA;3. Settling into adulthood (marriage, parenthood), so the cycle can continue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Transitioning from dependence (Mom! Could you do my laundry for me today?!?!?) to independence is *hard*. And we can all relate to it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;--- &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But you asked for What Campbell himself said in [The Hero with a Thousand Faces](http://amzn.com/1577315936) (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It has always been the prime function of mythology and rite to supply the symbols that carry the human spirit forward, in counteraction to those constant human fantasies that tent to tie it back. In fact, it may well be that the very high incidence of neuroticism among ourselves follows from the decline among us of such effective spiritual aid. **We remain fixated to the unexercised images of our infancy, and hence disinclined to the necessary passages of our adulthood. ** ... The psychoanalyst has to come along, at last, to assert again the tried wisdom of the older, forward looking teachings of the masked medicine dances and the witch-doctor-circumcisers; whereupon we find, as in the dream of the serpent bite, that ageless initiation symbolism is produced spontaneously by the patient himself at the moment of the release. Apparently, there is something in these initiatory images so necessary to the psyche that if they are not supplied from without, through myth and ritual, they will have to be announced again, through dream, from within-lest our energies remain locked in a banal, long-outmoded toy-room, at the bottom of the sea.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as a citation for Campbell saying that classic myths from many cultures follow this pattern, he said, again in The Hero with a Thousand Faces:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The wonder is that characteristic efficacy to touch and inspire deep creative centers dwells in the smallest nursery fair tale-as the flavor of the ocean is contained in a droplet or the whole mystery of life within the egg of a flea. For the symbols of mythology are not manufactured; they cannot be ordered, inveted, or permanently suppressed. They are spontaneous productions of the psyche, and each bears within it, undamaged, the germ power of its source.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What is the secret of the timeless vision? From what profundity of the mind does it derive? Why is mythology everywhere the same, beneath its varieties of costume? And what does it teach?" />

While hunting, he meets Arawn, king of Annwfn, who strikes a deal with him: The two will switch places for a year. At the end of the year, Pwyll will battle - and kill Hafgan, the other king of Annwfn, in Arawn's stead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both Arawn and Hafgan seem to posses magical powers - as evidenced by Arawn's hunting dogs and his ability to cast enchantments to change a person's appearance - while it does not seem that Pwyll had any special powers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the footnotes, an explanation for Pwyll's victory is given:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We see here that, rather like the Gawain, Pwyll is able to defeat the Annuvian king by following a prescribed form of behaviour, one that in many ways might seem somewhat counter-intuitive. The denouement of this act, as it were, is Pwyll's refusal to finish what he started and give Hafgan the mortal blow. The underlying implication of this act is that had Pwyll given in to his enemy's entreaty, he would have somehow failed to defeat him. Here, the natural laws of the Otherworld seem diametrically opposed to those of the mortal world, where destroying an enemy in this way would have been simple common sense.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given that Hafgan would (seemingly) have had the advantage over Pwyll, why did Arawn choose to swap? Wouldn't he have known of the rules of the Otherworld (Annwfn), given that he was one of its kings, and been able to use that to kill Hafgan?" />

(The day they went on a visit three Cantrevs provided for their entertainment, and they feasted until noon and drank until night, when they went to sleep. And then they devoured the heads of the vermin through hunger, as if they had never eaten anything. When they made a visit they left neither the fat nor the lean, neither the hot nor the cold, the sour nor the sweet, the fresh nor the salt, the boiled nor the raw.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And Gwevyl the son of Gwestad (on the day that he was sad, he would let one of his lips drop below his waist, while he turned upon the other like a cap upon his head). Uchtryd Varyf Draws (who spread his red untrimmed beard over the eight-and-forty rafters which were in Arthur's Hall).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there could be more than satire going on in this story. While the story Culhwch and Olwen has humorous overtones, that shouldn't detract from the &quot;sacredness&quot; of it. In fact, in many European stories, humor and seriousness exist at the same time. From [Mabinogion.info][4]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is crucial to realise the extent to which this differs from modern&#xD;&#xA;&gt; narrative-cultural norms, where the comedic and the dramatic are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mutually exclusive. Modern audiences have become accustomed to the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; specialised use of parodic humour as a device to undermine, deflate or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dismiss ‘serious’ genres; making it hard for us to understand how the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; comedic and the dramatic can co-exist within the same artistic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; expression. But such incompatability of genres has by no means always&#xD;&#xA;&gt; been the case. Just as the monstrous gargoyle can inhabit the same&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cathedral wall as the saintly icon; or the irreverent doodle can adorn&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the exegetical manuscript – it cannot always be said that the presence&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of humour or whimsy within the medieval narrative was intended to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; undermine its psycho-dramatic potency. Indeed, more often than not,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; such flourishes signalled a generalised intensification of affect: a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cultural experience in which all emotional registers (wonder,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hilarity, excitement, fear etc.) were simultaneously subject to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; heightened stimulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think that's pretty interesting.

Text="There are a few different accounts, detailed [here](http://www.timelessmyths.com/arthurian/women.html#Morgan):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. She was the half sister of none other than King Arthur himself, the daughter of King Gorlois and Igraine (Arthur's mother). She was most likely the aunt of Mordred, though one or two accounts give her as his mother.&#xD;&#xA; 2. She was one of nine sisters living in the land of Avalon (of course), who had magical, mystical powers, some of which may have been learned from Merlin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; In [*Vita Merlini*](http://www.maryjones.us/ctexts/merlini.html), by Geoffrey of Monmouth, Avalon and Morgana (Morgen) are described:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;That is the place where nine sisters exercise a kindly rule over those who come to them from our land. The one who is first among them has greater skill in healing, as her beauty surpasses that of her sisters. Her name is Morgen, and she has learned the uses of all plants in curing the ills of the body. She knows, too, the art of changing her shape, of flying through the air, like Daedalus, on strange wings. At will, she is now at Brest, now at Chartres, now at Pavia; and at will she glides down from the sky on to your shores.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; &gt; &quot;They say she had taught astrology to her sisters--Moronoe, Mazoe, Gliten, Glitonea, Gliton, Tyronoe, and Thiten,--Thiten, famous for her lyre.&#xD;&#xA; 3. She was a (perhaps Celtic) goddess, such as Morrigan or Modron (note the similarities in the names), or else a fairy queen. Her magical powers should be self-explanatory from these assumptions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This](http://www.kingarthursknights.com/others/morganlefay.asp) and [this](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/392293/Morgan-le-Fay) confirm the stories that she was one of the nine queens of Avalon, and that she learned from Merlin." />

I seek it from [list of names]&quot;). Because Culhwch needs not just Arthur’s help but also the help of his court, it makes sense that he asks each night individually -- it shows that member's of Arthur’s court are respected as individuals. In addition, the catalogue shows the size of Arthur's court.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In general, catalogue’s are used for similar reasons:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; By virtue of these three basic qualities, catalogues can be used to at least four different ends: (1) to describe characters of the plot, (2) to intensify the presentation of the events, (3) to foreshadow future events and create suspense, (4) and to provoke or increase the reader's emotional involvement in the narrative. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Gaertner, Jan, The Homeric Catalogues and Their Function in Epic Narrative][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this specific catalogue is also interesting for a completely different reason: **it is a parody of epic catalogues and other narrative techniques!** If you read the passage carefully, you will see some funny names:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Hirerwm and Hiratrwm. (The day they went on a visit three Cantrevs provided for their entertainment, and they feasted until noon and drank until night, when they went to sleep. And then they devoured the heads of the vermin through hunger, as if they had never eaten anything. When they made a visit they left neither the fat nor the lean, neither the hot nor the cold, the sour nor the sweet, the fresh nor the salt, the boiled nor the raw.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And Gwevyl the son of Gwestad (on the day that he was sad, he would let one of his lips drop below his waist, while he turned upon the other like a cap upon his head). Uchtryd Varyf Draws (who spread his red untrimmed beard over the eight-and-forty rafters which were in Arthur's Hall).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there could be more than satire going on in this story. While the story Culhwch and Olwen has humorous overtones, that shouldn't detract from the &quot;sacredness&quot; of it. In fact, in many European stories, humor and seriousness exist at the same time. From [Mabinogion.info][4]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is crucial to realise the extent to which this differs from modern&#xD;&#xA;&gt; narrative-cultural norms, where the comedic and the dramatic are&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mutually exclusive. Modern audiences have become accustomed to the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; specialised use of parodic humour as a device to undermine, deflate or&#xD;&#xA;&gt; dismiss ‘serious’ genres; making it hard for us to understand how the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; comedic and the dramatic can co-exist within the same artistic&#xD;&#xA;&gt; expression. But such incompatability of genres has by no means always&#xD;&#xA;&gt; been the case. Just as the monstrous gargoyle can inhabit the same&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cathedral wall as the saintly icon; or the irreverent doodle can adorn&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the exegetical manuscript – it cannot always be said that the presence&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of humour or whimsy within the medieval narrative was intended to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; undermine its psycho-dramatic potency. Indeed, more often than not,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; such flourishes signalled a generalised intensification of affect: a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; cultural experience in which all emotional registers (wonder,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; hilarity, excitement, fear etc.) were simultaneously subject to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; heightened stimulation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Basically, the fact that the story contains absurd jokes doesn't mean the story isn't serious.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epic_catalogue&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EpicCatalog&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/4477439 &#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://mabinogion.info/culhwch.htm" />

However, there were Woolly mammoths, which have the same long snouts. The *very last* known living [Woolly Mammoths were alive 6500 years ago](https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2005AM/finalprogram/abstract_97313.htm); the very earliest [Mayans were alive closer to 4000 years ago, in the Early Preclassic period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maya_civilization#History). So, while it's technically possible that the Mayans either knew about the Elephant snouts from when their [ancestors travelled over the Beringa Land Bridge 20000 years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beringia) or from Woolly Mammoth snout **fossils**, it seems unlikely.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Well, if not elephants or mammoths, why a snout?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first thing to note is that **Chaac did not always appear with a snout.** In [Mythology: Myths, Legends and Fantasies, page 481](https://books.google.com/books?id=p7dR2w1Wv2sC&amp;pg=PA481&amp;lpg=PA481&amp;dq=maya+chaac+snout&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NSwtTsVuA4&amp;sig=dyIY7i6V-xwIhqRYvHb-1PXWlYA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9LVLVdKkOMa3oQSjxIG4Ag&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCw#v=onepage&amp;q=maya%20chaac%20snout&amp;f=false) it says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Chaac appears in many faces and guises. Some images show him with a curled, snoutlike nose, and sometimes he is seen with scales or catfish whiskers, or with tears flowing from his eyes. Often he is seen painted blue and weilding an axe, which he uses to create lightning and thunder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So why did he have a snout? The same source says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Codz Poop building at Kabah in the Yucatan region of Mexico features 250 masks of Chaac. One of the many beliefs about Chaac is that he uses his **hooked nose to penetrate the clouds, causing rain to fall.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is an alternate reasoning for him to have the hooked nose - to part the clouds, not because he's elephant-like.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, Chaac's long nose doesn't always really remind of Elephants:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Chaac urn][1]&#xD;&#xA;![Chaac drawing][2]&#xD;&#xA;![Chaac statue][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/SXj8r.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/U5Xsy.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/dzi96.jpg" />

She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontus, without sweet union of love. But afterwards she lay with Heaven and bore deep-swirling Oceanus, Coeus and Crius and Hyperion and Iapetus, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoebe and lovely Tethys.

Plus, there was a fish-headed god in antiquity (not greco-romain).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A side note is that were was some mistranslations and some of the &quot;sirens&quot; in Greek tales were half-birds and not half-fish (harpies and not mermaids).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.crystalinks.com/sirens.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&quot;In Greek mythology, the Sirens were three dangerous bird-women, portrayed as seductresses who lured nearby sailors with their enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of their island. Roman poets placed them on an island called Sirenum scopuli. In some later, rationalized traditions, the literal geography of the &quot;flowery&quot; island of Anthemoessa, or Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae. All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;When the Sirens were given a parentage they were considered the daughters of the river god Achelous, fathered upon Terpsichore, Melpomene, Sterope, or Chthon (the Earth; in Euripides' Helen 167, Helen in her anguish calls upon &quot;Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth&quot;). Although they lured mariners, for the Greeks the Sirens in their &quot;meadow starred with flowers&quot; were not sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Their number is variously reported as between two and five. In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens as two. Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Sirens of Greek mythology are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as fully aquatic and mermaid-like; the facts that in Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Portuguese the word for mermaid is respectively Sirena, Sirene, Sirena, Syrena, Sirena and Sereia, and that in biology the Sirenia comprise an order of fully aquatic mammals that includes the dugong and manatee, add to the visual confusion, so that Sirens are even represented as mermaids. However, &quot;the sirens, though they sing to mariners, are not sea-maidens,&quot; Harrison had cautioned; &quot;they dwell on an island in a flowery meadow.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Sinologist [Herrlee Glessner Creel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrlee_Creel) says in [The Origins of Statecraft in China:](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Statecraft_in_China.html?id=F5d1mQEACAAJ)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For three thousand years it has been believed that from time immemorial all Chinese revered T'ien 天, &quot;Heaven,&quot; as the highest deity, and that this same deity was also known as Ti 帝 or Shang Ti 上帝. But the new materials that have become available in the present century, and especially the Shang inscriptions, make it evident that this was not the case. It appears rather that T'ien is not named at all in the Shang inscriptions, which instead refer with great frequency to Ti or Shang Ti. T'ien appears only with the Chou, and was apparently a Chou deity. After the conquest the Chou considered T'ien to be identical with the Shang deity Ti (or Shang Ti), much as the Romans identified the Greek Zeus with their Jupiter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in China this phrase **&quot;Son of Heaven&quot; should not be taken literally.** In [Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization](http://books.google.com/books/about/Heritage_of_China.html?id=zm6Sm64y5CwC), it states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The ruler soon bore a new title that was based on the legitimating concept of the Mandate of Heaven: the Son of Heaven. The term **was not taken in the literal sense to mean that the Chou king was descended from Heaven** and therefore divine, but it did convey the idea that the King had been chosen by Heaven. Just as lineage heads were patrimonially responsible to the Chou king, so too was he responsible, as a son, to Heaven, who could withdraw the mandate and confer it on a more deserving, that is, a more morally responsible, ruling house." />

Citizens of Pylos that stood in his way suffered a similar fate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this, because Heracles felt Neleus had insulted him. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, Heracles wasn't known for running away from a fight. However, going into battle and slaughtering a city over an insult feels a bit out of character for the classical version of the legend. Furthermore, overcoming not one but four Olympians is simply too magnificent a feat. Some, including [Pindar][3], are highly skeptical of the story: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For how could Heracles have wielded his club against the trident, when Poseidon took his stand to guard Pylos, and pressed him hard, and Phoebus pressed him hard, attacking with his silver bow; nor did Hades keep his staff unmoved, with which he leads mortal bodies down to the hollow path of the dead.

This his probably why he cared enough about the city to be personally present for the battle. There was one cult in the main city itself:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [2] The sacred enclosure of Hades and its temple （for the Eleans have these among their possessions） are opened once every year, but not even on this occasion is anybody permitted to enter except the priest. The following is the reason why the Eleans worship Hades; they are the only men we know of so to do. It is said that, when Heracles was leading an expedition against Pylus in Elis, Athena was one of his allies. Now among those who came to fight on the side of the Pylians was Hades, who was the foe of Heracles but was worshipped at Pylus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [3] Homer is quoted in support of the story, who says in the Iliad:“And among them huge Hades suffered a wound from a swift arrow,&#xD;&#xA;When the same man, the son of aegis-bearing Zeus,&#xD;&#xA;Hit him in Pylus among the dead, and gave him over to pains.&#xD;&#xA;”Hom. Il. 5.395-397If in the expedition of Agamemnon and Menelaus against Troy Poseidon was according to Homer an ally of the Greeks, it cannot be unnatural for the same poet to hold that Hades helped the Pylians. At any rate it was in the belief that the god was their friend but the enemy of Heracles that the Eleans made the sanctuary for him. The reason why they are wont to open it only once each year is, I suppose, because men too go down only once to Hades.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [Pausanias, Description of Greece 6. 25. 2-3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D25%3Asection%3D2)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There was also a nearby precinct devoted to Hades at Mount [Minthe](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Minthe), a mountain named after a nymph who was Hades' concubine:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Near Pylus, towards the east, is a mountain named after Minthe, who, according to myth, became the concubine of Hades, was trampled under foot by Core, and was transformed into garden-mint, the plant which some call Hedyosmos.4 Furthermore, near the mountain is a precinct sacred to Hades, which is revered by the Macistians too,5 and also a grove sacred to Demeter, which is situated above the Pylian plain. This plain is fertile; it borders on the sea and stretches along the whole distance between Samicum and the River Neda.

They see many blessed sights in the inner heaven, and there are many ways to and fro, along which the blessed gods are passing, every one doing his own work; he may follow who will and can, for jealousy has no place in the celestial choir. But when they go to banquet and festival, then they move up the steep to the top of the vault of heaven. The chariots of the gods in even poise, obeying the rein, glide rapidly; but the others labour, for the vicious steed goes heavily, weighing down the charioteer to the earth when his steed has not been thoroughly trained:-and this is the hour of agony and extremest conflict for the soul. For the immortals, when they are at the end of their course, go forth and stand upon the outside of heaven, and the revolution of the spheres carries them round, and they behold the things beyond.&amp;mdash;Plato, [_Phaedrus_](http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/phaedrus.html) [246e-247c]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A plausible interpretation is that the twelve groups are the [signs of the Zodiac](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac#Hellenistic_and_Roman_era). So Plato suggests at least three different connections between the number of Olympians other sets of twelve:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Monthly festivals,&#xD;&#xA;* The Zodiac, and&#xD;&#xA;* Greek tribes.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tolkien, in [&quot;On Fairy-Stories&quot;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Fairy-Stories), talks about the &quot;Cauldron of Story&quot; in which elements of myths get pulled apart, mixed around, and combined to produce the stories that are told and retold. Classical-period mythology used [Homeric epics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeric_Question) as it's base elements, but storytellers (such as Plato's Socrates) were free to create their own organizing structure. There is no fixed membership among the [Twelve](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Olympians) because different storytellers had different visions of Zeus' court. Even a single author, such as Plato, might have different versions designed for [different purposes](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/plato-myths/#MytTeaToo).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From this distance, it's probably impossible for us to identify the original connection between the number 12 and the Olympic gods and goddesses. But once the number became attracted, it stuck because of the variety of associations with other groups of twelve. It's not so much that the number was special as that the gods and the number became entwined in each other." />

In fact, they are ***not*** both fox spirits with ***nine tails*.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;**Left:** A nine-tailed fox depicted in the ancient Chinese bestiary [*Classic of Mountains and Seas* `(山海經)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas) | **Right:** A distinctly single tailed *kitsune* depicted in the Japanese almanac `kin mou zui (訓蒙図彙)`&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fox spirits of later Chinese traditions do not necessarily have nine tails, either. Similarly, Japan later imported the Chinese nine-tailed fox, but it found a place in Japanese folklore as a distinct entity separate from the traditional *kitsune*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although they share notable similarities, the Japanese *kitsune* and the Chinese *hulijing* actually have fundamental differences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Japanese language, the word [`kitsune`](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%84%E3%83%8D) **literally just means &quot;a fox&quot;**. There's no difference between that and the fox as an animal. As this would imply, the *kitsune* are regarded as simply common foxes, though held to be naturally long lived and attributed with magical abilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In contrast, the Chinese `hulijing` means **specifically a &quot;fox *spirit*&quot;**. They are no ordinary foxes, but instead the result of centuries or even millenia of [training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C4%81dhan%C4%81). Some tales further describe them as engaging in powerleveling through essence-sucking intercourse with mortal humans à la western [succubi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus) or [incubi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [*Classic of Mountains and Seas*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas) for instance mentions that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 有獸焉，其狀如狐而九尾，其音如嬰兒，能食人；食者不蠱。&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is a beast, which is **shaped like a fox** but has nine tails, and sounds like a baby. It eats men; eating it wards off evil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which clearly shows that the fox spirit is considered distinct from normal foxes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another difference manifests in the worship of the two entities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In traditional Japanese folklore, the *kitsune* have an essential feature as messengers of the god of rice productivity and prosperity, the [`inari ōkami (稲荷大神)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inari_%C5%8Ckami).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In Japan, however, the fox known as *kitsune* has since the eight century been enshrined and worshipped in a pervasive network of sacred associations in connection with Inari. The widespread cult portrays *kitsune* as a divine messenger of the rice god who promotes agrarian fertility as well as productivity and prosperity in a much broader sense.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Heine, Steven. Shifting Shape, Shaping Text: Philosophy and Folklore in the Fox Kōan. University of Hawaii Press, 1999.&lt;/sub&gt;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The association had formed as early as the 8th century and remains extremely strong to this day. The kitsune continues to feature in tens of thousands of Inari shrines across Japan, as recipients of fried tofu and rubbing by sickly miracle-seekers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;A stone *kitsune* at the [Fushimi Inari Taisha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha), the chief shrine of the Inari god.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In contrast, in Chinese folklore fox spirits have a much more ambiguous standing. For instance [Ji Xiaolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji_Yun) in his *Notes of the Thatched Abode of Close Observations* that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 幽明異路，狐則在幽明之間。仙妖殊途，狐則在仙妖之間。&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dark and light are different, but foxes are between dark and light. Humans and objects are different, and foxes are between humasn [Hsien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)) and [Yao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoguai) are different, but foxes are between the two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike the worship of *kitsune* in major shrines as messengers of a rice god, the foxes of China were prayed to in private homes as one of a group of five animal spirits. Exact compositions vary, but these typically includes  weasels, snakes, hedgehogs and rats. Families would offer sacrifices in the hopes of receiving protection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no real evidence that the Chinese and Japanese versions share a common origin. Fox worship is ancient in Japan; the earliest documentation of fox folklores appeared in the late 8th century [`nihon ryōiki (日本霊異記)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Ry%C5%8Diki), lit. *Chronicles of Supernatural Tales of Japan.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is almost as early as the first written works of any kind in Japan, and reelates the tale of a fox assuming the form of a woman and marrying a human. The tale claims the incident to be the origin of the term *kitsune*, but that is almost certainly an invented etymology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 昔欽明天皇御世、三乃國大乃郡人應為妻、覓好孃乘路而行。時曠野中遇於姝女。其女媚壯、馴之壯睇之。言:「何行稚孃?」孃答:「將覓能緣而行女也。」壯亦語言:「成我妻耶?」女:「聽」答言、即將於家、交通相住。此頃懷任、生一男子。時其家犬、十二月十五日生子。彼犬之子每向家室、而期剋睚眥嘷吠。家室脅惶、告家長言:「此犬打殺。」雖然患告、而猶不殺。於二月三月之頃、設年米舂時、其家室於稻舂女等、將充間食入於碓屋。即彼犬將咋家室而追吠。即驚澡恐、成野干、登籠上而居。家長見、言:「汝與我之中子相生、故吾不忘汝。每來相寐。」故誦夫語而來寐。故名為岐都禰也。時彼妻著紅襴染裳、而窈窕裳襴引逝也。夫視去容、戀歌曰: 古比波未奈加我宇弊邇於知奴多万可支流波呂可邇美江天伊爾師古由惠邇。故其令相生子名、號岐都禰。亦、其子姓負、狐直也。是人、強力多有、走疾如鳥飛矣。三乃國狐直等根本是也。&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (very roughly) During the reign of [Kinmei Tennō](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Kinmei), a man was looking for a bride and met a pretty woman who was looking for a husband. They started sleeping together and produced a baby boy on December 15. Tthe family dog gave birth too and the puppy was aggressive towards the woman, chasing her. Frightened, she turned into a [`yakan`](http://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=%C5%9B%E1%B9%9Bg%C4%81la) and fled. The man saw and pled, &quot;You and I have a child together, I cannot forget you. Come (`kitsu`) back to sleep (`ne`) at least.&quot; She agreed. This is where the name `kitsune` comes from (...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Either version of fox worship were later affected by the Indian version, which spread through both China and Japan by way of Buddhism. The nine tailed fox, for instance, was introduced to Japan in the form of an ancient fox spirit from Indian. It is said to have tried to overthrow an ancient Indian kingdom, and later became [Consort Daji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daji) who helped brought about the Shang Dynasty's downfall. The spirit eventually made it to Japan, where nine-tails became a distinct spirit different from the usual *kitsune*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/MBuQx.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/WNwL3.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ptysq.jpg" />

In his dwelling place, in the pool, Mukiti heard the news that downstream from him there was a chief who had a sister called Iyangura.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(all quotes are from *A Treasury of African Folklore*, the same source of the quotes in the question.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second piece of evidence is that once Mukiti marries Iyangura, he traps her in his village while he returns to his supernatural pool. This has nothing to do with Mwindo, who isn't even born yet:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [Mukiti] made a proclamation  saying &quot;You, all my people, if one day you see a man going downstream, then you will tear out his spinal column, you Banamaka, Banabirurmba, Banankomo, Banatubusa, and Banampongo; however, this path here which follows the flow of the river, it is the great path on which all people pass.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After he had passed this interdiction regarding these two paths, and while in his village there lives his Shemwami called Kasiyembe, Mukiti told his big headman Kasiyembe: &quot;You, go to dwell with my wife Iyangura at the borders of the pool; and I Mukiti shall from now on always reside here where all the dry leaves collect in flowing down, where all the fallen tree trunks are obstructed in the middle of the pool.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I am still confused by the order about the &quot;path... which follows the flow of the river,&quot; but the rest seems clear to me. Mukiti has taken Iyangura to the edge of a supernatural pool, where he will live. He doesn't want anyone to take her from the supernatural world, so he has her live with his headman and instructs his subjects to stop people from approaching the village. I find it extraordinarily relevant that the pool is described as the place &quot;where all the dry leaves collect in flowing down&quot;: to me, it suggests that Mukiti and the pool are supernatural and exist at the center of the spiritual universe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some quotes where Mwindo sings about how he will defeat Mukiti:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For Mukiti shall I get out of my way?  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; You see I am going to encounter Iyangura,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Iyangury, sister of Shemwindo.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mukiti, you are powerless against Mwindo.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Mwindo is the Little-one-just-born-he-walked.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is an interesting story, but unfortunately the book I'm reading it from cuts the story off shortly after Mwindo meets his aunt. I'm going to have to get the full story from somewhere (the book I'm reading excerpts it from *The Mwindo Epic*, translated and edited by Daniel Biebuyck and Kohombo Mateene)." />

Text="[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charon%27s_obol) actually has an interesting interpretation:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Attempts to explain the symbolism of the rite also must negotiate the illogical placement of the coin in the mouth. The Latin term *viaticum* makes sense of Charon’s obol as “sustenance for the journey,” and it has been suggested that coins replaced offerings of food for the dead in Roman tradition.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This dichotomy of food for the living and gold for the dead is a theme in the myth of King Midas, versions of which draw on elements of the Dionysian mysteries. The Phrygian king's famous &quot;golden touch&quot; was a divine gift from Dionysus, but its acceptance separated him from the human world of nourishment and reproduction: both his food and his daughter were transformed by contact with him into immutable, unreciprocal gold. In some versions of the myth, Midas's hard-won insight into the meaning of life and the limitations of earthly wealth is accompanied by conversion to the cult of Dionysus. Having learned his lessons as an initiate into the mysteries, and after ritual immersion in the river Pactolus, Midas forsakes the “bogus eternity” of gold for spiritual rebirth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Wikipedia also says,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In Latin, Charon's obol sometimes is called a viaticum, or &quot;sustenance for the journey&quot;; the placement of the coin on the mouth has been explained also as a seal to protect the deceased's soul or to prevent it from returning.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The basis for these interpretations are analyses of Latin writers; the theories stem from, among others, &quot;Charon's Obol&quot; by Susan T. Stevens (see below), *Money and the Early Greek Mind: Homer, Philosophy, Tragedy*, by Richard Seaford, and *Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion*, by John Cuthbert Lawson. The above quotes are condensations of their work as historians.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I may be reading too much into this, but [*The Golden Ass*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Ass), by Apuleius, [contains this passage](http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Kharon.html) (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (So even among the dead, greed enjoys its life; even that great god Charon, who gathers taxes for Dis [Haides], does not do anything for nothing. A poor man on the point of death must find his fare, and **no one will let him breathe his last until he has his copper ready.**) You must allow this squalid elder to take for your fare one of the coins you are to carry, but he must remove it form your mouth with his own hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems to support the idea that the coin sealed a dead person's mouth, but it could be merely a complete coincidence; &quot;breathe his last&quot; could be used in place of &quot;die&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*Charon's Obol and Other Coins in Ancient Funerary Practice*, by Susan T. Stevens](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/1088792?uid=2134&amp;uid=391386161&amp;uid=3739808&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=391386151&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=3&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=60&amp;purchase-type=article&amp;accessType=none&amp;sid=21106252287221&amp;showMyJstorPss=false&amp;seq=6&amp;showAccess=false), gives evidence to support the *viaticum*-coin-as-sustenance theory, citing Apuleis's usage but as food, not breath. She does mention that other &quot;Latin authors&quot; (unspecified) wrote that the coin was used to seal the mouth to prevent the soul from escaping.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two main theories, therefore, are&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Coins provide &quot;sustenance&quot; for the journey, like food, and so are placed on the mouth.&#xD;&#xA; - Coins seal the mouth, which is the only opening from which a soul could escape. This could also be symbolic, e.g. representing the fact that the dead cannot talk." />

In fact, they are ***not*** both fox spirits with ***nine tails*.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][1]![enter image description here][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;**Left:** A nine-tailed fox depicted in the ancient Chinese bestiary [*Classic of Mountains and Seas* `(山海經)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas) | **Right:** A distinctly single tailed *kitsune* depicted in the Japanese almanac `kin mou zui (訓蒙図彙)`&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fox spirits of later Chinese traditions do not necessarily have nine tails, either. Similarly, Japan later imported the Chinese nine-tailed fox, but it found a place in Japanese folklore as a distinct entity separate from the traditional *kitsune*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Although they share notable similarities, such as transformation and betwitching humans, the Japanese *kitsune* and the Chinese *hulijing* actually have fundamental differences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the Japanese language, the word [`kitsune`](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E3%82%AD%E3%83%84%E3%83%8D) **literally just means &quot;a fox&quot;**. There's no difference between that and the fox as an animal. As this would imply, the *kitsune* are regarded as simply common foxes, though held to be naturally long lived and attributed with magical abilities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In contrast, the Chinese `hulijing` means **specifically a &quot;fox *spirit*&quot;**. They are no ordinary foxes, but instead the result of centuries or even millenia of [training](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%C4%81dhan%C4%81). Some tales further describe them as engaging in powerleveling through essence-sucking intercourse with mortal humans à la western [succubi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succubus) or [incubi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incubus).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [*Classic of Mountains and Seas*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas) for instance mentions that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 有獸焉，其狀如狐而九尾，其音如嬰兒，能食人；食者不蠱。&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is a beast, which is **shaped like a fox** but has nine tails, and sounds like a baby. It eats men; eating it wards off evil.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which clearly shows that the fox spirit is considered distinct from normal foxes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also a host of minor differences, such as the *kitsune*'s reputed love for fried tofu versus the *hulijing*'s preference for eggs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another major difference exists in the worship of the two entities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In traditional Japanese folklore, the *kitsune* have an essential feature as messengers of the god of rice productivity and prosperity, the [`inari ōkami (稲荷大神)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inari_%C5%8Ckami).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In Japan, however, the fox known as *kitsune* has since the eight century been enshrined and worshipped in a pervasive network of sacred associations in connection with Inari. The widespread cult portrays *kitsune* as a divine messenger of the rice god who promotes agrarian fertility as well as productivity and prosperity in a much broader sense.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **&lt;sub&gt; - Heine, Steven. Shifting Shape, Shaping Text: Philosophy and Folklore in the Fox Kōan. University of Hawaii Press, 1999.&lt;/sub&gt;**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The association had formed as early as the 8th century and remains extremely strong to this day. The kitsune continues to feature in tens of thousands of Inari shrines across Japan, as recipients of fried tofu and rubbing by sickly miracle-seekers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;A stone *kitsune* at the [Fushimi Inari Taisha](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fushimi_Inari-taisha), the chief shrine of the Inari god.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In contrast, in Chinese folklore fox spirits have a much more ambiguous standing. For instance [Ji Xiaolan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ji_Yun) in his *Notes of the Thatched Abode of Close Observations* that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 幽明異路，狐則在幽明之間。仙妖殊途，狐則在仙妖之間。&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Dark and light are different, but foxes are between dark and light. Humans and objects are different, and foxes are between humasn [Hsien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)) and [Yao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yaoguai) are different, but foxes are between the two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unlike the worship of *kitsune* in major shrines as messengers of a rice god, the foxes of China were prayed to in private homes as one of a group of five animal spirits. Exact compositions vary, but these typically includes  weasels, snakes, hedgehogs and rats. Families would offer sacrifices in the hopes of receiving protection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is no real evidence that the Chinese and Japanese versions share a common origin. Fox worship is ancient in Japan; the earliest documentation of fox folklores appeared in the late 8th century [`nihon ryōiki (日本霊異記)`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nihon_Ry%C5%8Diki), lit. *Chronicles of Supernatural Tales of Japan.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That is almost as early as the first written works of any kind in Japan, and reelates the tale of a fox assuming the form of a woman and marrying a human. The tale claims the incident to be the origin of the term *kitsune*, but that is almost certainly an invented etymology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 昔欽明天皇御世、三乃國大乃郡人應為妻、覓好孃乘路而行。時曠野中遇於姝女。其女媚壯、馴之壯睇之。言:「何行稚孃?」孃答:「將覓能緣而行女也。」壯亦語言:「成我妻耶?」女:「聽」答言、即將於家、交通相住。此頃懷任、生一男子。時其家犬、十二月十五日生子。彼犬之子每向家室、而期剋睚眥嘷吠。家室脅惶、告家長言:「此犬打殺。」雖然患告、而猶不殺。於二月三月之頃、設年米舂時、其家室於稻舂女等、將充間食入於碓屋。即彼犬將咋家室而追吠。即驚澡恐、成野干、登籠上而居。家長見、言:「汝與我之中子相生、故吾不忘汝。每來相寐。」故誦夫語而來寐。故名為岐都禰也。時彼妻著紅襴染裳、而窈窕裳襴引逝也。夫視去容、戀歌曰: 古比波未奈加我宇弊邇於知奴多万可支流波呂可邇美江天伊爾師古由惠邇。故其令相生子名、號岐都禰。亦、其子姓負、狐直也。是人、強力多有、走疾如鳥飛矣。三乃國狐直等根本是也。&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (very roughly) During the reign of [Kinmei Tennō](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Kinmei), a man was looking for a bride and met a pretty woman who was looking for a husband. They started sleeping together and produced a baby boy on December 15. Tthe family dog gave birth too and the puppy was aggressive towards the woman, chasing her. Frightened, she turned into a [`yakan`](http://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=%C5%9B%E1%B9%9Bg%C4%81la) and fled. The man saw and pled, &quot;You and I have a child together, I cannot forget you. Come (`kitsu`) back to sleep (`ne`) at least.&quot; She agreed. This is where the name `kitsune` comes from (...)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Japanese *kitsune* ultimately absorbed elements, particularly of malice, from the Chinese *hulijing*. Both traditions were further affected by the Indian version, which spread through both China and Japan by way of Buddhism. The Buddhist spirit [ḍākinī](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakini) for example was syncretised with native Inari worship to become a fox spirit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The nine tailed fox, additionally, was introduced to Japan both as a general concept as well as a specific ancient fox spirit from India. It is said to have tried to overthrow an ancient Indian kingdom, and later brought about the Shang Dynasty's downfall as [Consort Daji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daji). The spirit eventually made it to Japan and became [Tamamo-no-Mae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamamo-no-Mae) before being exposed and vanquished.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;The Nine-Tailed Fox terrorising Indian Prince Hanzoku, by 19th century painter [Utagawa Kuniyoshi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utagawa_Kuniyoshi)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/MBuQx.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/WNwL3.png&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/Ptysq.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/16Qi0.jpg" />

In many myths, the number 7 is used for both good and bad events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then Ra repented. His fierce anger passed away, and he sought to save the remnant of mankind. He sent messengers, who ran swifter than the storm wind, unto Elephantine, so that they might obtain speedily many plants of virtue.

For example 666 would signify&#xD;&#xA;eternal unrest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the repetition is 3 times - three being the number of holiness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The number 7 is extremely frequent in Christianity - the Book Of Revelations mentions 7 churches, 7 trumpets, 7 bowls, 7 seals and 7 spirits. This tends to confirm that 7 is used to make a _complete set_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Greece and the origin of the 7 in Christianity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;While the reason about the origin of the number 7 in Egypt is hard to know, there are sources trying to explain where the 7 came to mean &quot;perfection&quot; in christian myths.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Greeks considered 6 to be a perfect number, because of its **divisibility**. A sixth is one, or unity. A third is two, a half is 3, etc. The foot is also a sixth of the human size, so 6 represented the human. Finally, it is the sum of its divisers.[More here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pope Gregory I found similar properties in the number 7, aswell as considering it representing **eternity** according to *Dialectics and Humanism*, vol. VII, no. 2. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This changed a lot - While Saint Augustine wrote that the world had been created in 6 days, this changed to 7 in the Middle Ages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason behind the Seven Sages of Greece seems thus not to be linked to mythology or religion." />

In effect, both goats would be offered to the same God, in two different aspects and locations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He concludes as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Jewish tradition associates the outstanding manifestations or attributes of God with the deity’s various names. Thus with יהוה is associated “mercy,” with אלהים “justice,” with שלום “peace,” etc. It has been shown that significant evidence suggests that biblical עזאזל was originally the homophone עזזאל “Powerful God,” whose abode on earth was in the desert. Perhaps, עזזאל was associated with the deity’s attribute of strength, explaining the coming of the deity from the desert in theophanies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The ritual described in Lev 16:5–26 was to the same God, potentially being at two locations—the Temple or the desert, and identified as יהוה and עזזאל respectively. This would explain the meticulous rite of ensuring sameness of sacrifice and leaving the final pick of the scapegoat to God via the procedure of a lot. On the unique Day of Atonement God (as יהוה and עזזאל ) was approached at both locations, there could not be even the slightest show of preference.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In later times, God’s abode in the Temple or Jerusalem completely displaced God’s desert abode, relegating it to evil forces as was the belief in Near-Eastern cultures. In this process עזזאל , or a derivative of this name, became a satanic figure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is hardly the only available interpretation, but he makes a very compelling, and well-supported, case." />

In many myths, the number 7 is used for both good and bad events.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then Ra repented. His fierce anger passed away, and he sought to save the remnant of mankind. He sent messengers, who ran swifter than the storm wind, unto Elephantine, so that they might obtain speedily many plants of virtue. These they brought back, and they were well ground and steeped with barley in vessels filled with the blood of mankind. So was beer made and seven thousand jars were filled with it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In the seventh hour-division sits Osiris, divine judge of the dead.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You can find these texts and more [here](http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/eml/eml04.htm). &#xD;&#xA;[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numbers_in_Egyptian_mythology) lists a lot of occurences of the number 7.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In judeo-christian myths&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;This idea of perfection and completeness is [found in judeo-christian beliefs as well](http://faculty.lasierra.edu/~wclarke/nhmx.pdf) :&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Roy Alan Anderson in Unfolding the Revelationi&#xD;&#xA; notices that to the Hebrew:&#xD;&#xA; 6 represented unrest,&#xD;&#xA; 7 perfection and&#xD;&#xA; 8 victory. &#xD;&#xA;When the number is repeated then it signifies an eternal quality. For example 666 would signify&#xD;&#xA;eternal unrest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that the repetition is 3 times - three being the number of holiness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The number 7 is extremely frequent in Christianity - the Book Of Revelations mentions 7 churches, 7 trumpets, 7 bowls, 7 seals and 7 spirits. This tends to confirm that 7 is used to make a _complete set_.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;In Greece and the origin of the 7 in Christianity&lt;/h2&gt;&#xD;&#xA;While the reason about the origin of the number 7 in Egypt is hard to know, there are sources trying to explain where the 7 came to mean &quot;perfection&quot; in christian myths.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Greeks considered 6 to be a perfect number, because of its **divisibility**. A sixth is one, or unity. A third is two, a half is 3, etc. The foot is also a sixth of the human size, so 6 represented the human. Finally, it is the sum of its divisers. [More here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Pope Gregory I found similar properties in the number 7, aswell as considering it representing **eternity** according to *Dialectics and Humanism*, vol. VII, no. 2. One of the reasons given for his fascination with the number is [its presence in Antique history : the Seven Wonders, the seven stages of man, the seven planets...](http://www.le.ac.uk/arthistory/seedcorn/faq-sds.html) &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The number Seven always represented a complete set.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This changed a lot - While Saint Augustine wrote that the world had been created in 6 days, this changed to 7 in the Middle Ages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reason behind the Seven Sages of Greece seems thus not to be linked to mythology or religion." />

So, it's worth noting that&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The foundations of the Bronze Age city Ugarit were divided into quarters. In the north-east quarter of the walled enclosure, the remains of three significant religious buildings were discovered, including two temples (of the gods Baal Hadad and Dagon) and a building referred to as the library or the high priest's house. Within these structures atop the acropolis numerous invaluable mythological texts were found. These texts have provided the basis for understanding of the Canaanite mythological world and religion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ~ [Wikipedia: Ugaritic Religion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugarit#Ugaritic_religion)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;[Baal](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=baal&amp;qs_version=NIV)&quot; and &quot;[Dagon](https://www.biblegateway.com/quicksearch/?quicksearch=dagon&amp;qs_version=NIV)&quot; both appear in the Old Testament as Canaanite/Philistine/pagan gods.

Yahweh doesn't have a son.&#xD;&#xA; - King Keret almost died. Jehovah's son wasn't mortal until his birth around 3-4 A.D., give or take 2 years. These myths are separated by 1200-1500 years. (Plus, Jehovah's son *did* die [and was resurrected, but that's beside the point].)&#xD;&#xA; - There are multiple positive/neutral references to gods (such as Baal, Asherah, and Ashtoreth) in the Legend of Keret that are strongly condemned in the Old Testament.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if the god &quot;El&quot; referred to in the Legend of Keret and the god that became known as Yahweh used to be the same, so to speak, by the time any of the books in the Bible were written, they were certainly different gods." />

Wellhausen believed Yahweh to be the same as El, and more recently this has been particularly argued by F.M. Cross and J.C. de Moor. However, the following arguments may be brought against this. First, in the Ugaritic texts the god El is revealed to be wholly benevolent in nature, whereas Yahweh has a fierce as well as a kind side. Secondly, as T.N.D. Mettinger has rightly emphasized, the earliest evidence, such as that found in Judg. 5.4-5, associates Yahweh with the storm, which was not something with which El was connected at all. Rather, this is reminiscent of Baal. Thirdly, as for F.M. Cross's view that Yahweh was originally a part of El's cultic title, 'El who creates hosts' (*'il ḏū yahwī ṣaba'ōt*), this is pure speculation. The formula in question is nowhere attested, whether inside or outside the Bible. Cross's reasons for thinking that *yhwh ṣb't* cannot simply mean 'Lord of hosts', namely, that a proper name should not appear in the construct, is incorrect. Further *hyh (hwh)* is not attested in Hebrew in the hiphil ('cause to be', 'create'), though this is case in Aramaic and Syriac. Yahweh in any case more likely means 'he is' (qal) rather than 'he causes to be/creates' (hiphil): to suppose otherwise requires emendation of the Hebrew text in Exod. 3.14 (*'ehyeh*, 'I am'), which explains the name Yahweh. **I conclude, therefore, that El and Yahweh were originally distinct deities that became amalgamated.** This view was held as long ago as F.K. Movers, and has been argued since by scholars such as O. Eissfeldt and T.N.D. Mettinger.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [Yahweh and the Gods and Goddesses of Canaan, John Day, 13-14](http://books.google.com/books?id=y-gfwlltlRwC)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This section in the book is very well cited and I recommend following up on his different sources; it also goes on quite fascinatingly at some length, but to do so is outside the scope of this answer." />

All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;When the Sirens were given a parentage they were considered the daughters of the river god Achelous, fathered upon Terpsichore, Melpomene, Sterope, or Chthon (the Earth; in Euripides' Helen 167, Helen in her anguish calls upon &quot;Winged maidens, daughters of the Earth&quot;). Although they lured mariners, for the Greeks the Sirens in their &quot;meadow starred with flowers&quot; were not sea deities. Roman writers linked the Sirens more closely to the sea, as daughters of Phorcys.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Their number is variously reported as between two and five. In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, but gives the number of the Sirens as two. Later writers mention both their names and number: some state that there were three, Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The Sirens of Greek mythology are sometimes portrayed in later folklore as fully aquatic and mermaid-like; the facts that in Spanish, French, Italian, Polish, Romanian and Portuguese the word for mermaid is respectively Sirena, Sirene, Sirena, Syrena, Sirena and Sereia, and that in biology the Sirenia comprise an order of fully aquatic mammals that includes the dugong and manatee, add to the visual confusion, so that Sirens are even represented as mermaids. However, &quot;the sirens, though they sing to mariners, are not sea-maidens,&quot; Harrison had cautioned; &quot;they dwell on an island in a flowery meadow.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Complaints are brought to him and he rules by decrees and ordinances, in a very bureaucratic way. Everyone in Heaven has a specific job to do and need to report on said job to him. Slackers are shown to be punished severely.  &#xD;&#xA;The Jade Emperor is also shown to be sometimes proud, inflexible and short-tempered. This depiction seems peculiar to me: one would expect the ruler of Heaven to show some temperance, leniency and humility, and the Heaven that the Immortals longed for to be a little more relaxing.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Additionally, the powers of the Jade Emperor seems to be purely (as for a human emperor) its authority. When he decides to stop Sun Wukong he has to send an army after him. When Sun Wukong wrecks the Peach Banquet, he has to order an investigation to know what happens, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This contrasts a lot with the depiction of the Buddha in the book, who manage to trick Sun Wukong to be trapped under his hand, that he then transforms into a mountain. This contrast lead me to think that maybe the depiction of the Jade Emperor and his Heaven is biased.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now I'm aware that the author veers frequently away from the canon of chinese mythology (even if most of the novel is just a rewriting of classic folkloric tales), but how far does the depiction of the Jade Emperor and his Heaven deviate from the canonical chinese mythology?" />

The simplest source for this is Wikipedia - though it's corroborated in many places:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In wider Germanic mythology and paganism, Odin was known in Old English as Wóden, in Old Saxon as Wōden, and in Old High German as Wuotan or Wodan, all stemming from the reconstructed Proto-Germanic theonym *wōđanaz.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, Woden's Hall is almost certainly [Valhalla](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valhalla), a hall where the fiercest Nordic warriors would sit around waiting for [Ragnarok](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragnar%C3%B6k). So what is Valhalla like, as far magic drink is like? For that, we go to the Poetic Edda:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 23.

However, there is other evidence supporting the lack of a patron; we have this passage from [*Germania*, by Gaius Cornelius Tacitus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germania_(book)):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Germans, however, do not consider it consistent with the grandeur of celestial beings to confine the gods within walls, or to liken them to the form of any human countenance.

They live scattered and apart, just as a spring, a meadow, or a wood has attracted them.

The term derives from Germanic *\*wtha* and designates heathen shrines and sacred places in the widest sense of the word. Even the homes of the gods in mythological poetry of the *Edda* (*Vafthruthnismol*, 51) are called *vé*, and the word occurs repeatedly in skaldic poetry....&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Place-names reveal the wide distribution of shrines with the name *vé* in Scandinavia: in Sweden there are more than 80 place-names based on *-vé*, 18 of them found with the name of the god Ullr, 16 with Skaði, 8 with Freyr, but only 4 with Odin and 2 with Thor. In addition to this there are a large number of place-names based on *-vé* which use geographical elements (e.g. Visby). In Denmark, on the other hand, all 5 place names based on *-vé* are combined with Odin (e.g. Odense). Most of the few Norwegian place names called Ve are not compound, and in Iceland there are none whatsoever.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [A Dictionary of Modern Mythology, Simek, 355](http://www.amazon.com/Dictionary-Northern-Mythology-Rudolf-Simek/dp/0859915131)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Given the existence of temples to multiple gods at once, the lack of cities throughout the region with which to be patron cities, and the existence of many shrines to the same gods distributed all over scandinavia, it doesn't seem as if there were any patron **cities** or **regions** to one particular god; though there were smaller shrines and geographic formations that were dedicated to one god." />

Fortunately, [Henry Adams Bellows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Adams_Bellows) has already done such an analysis in the introduction to the Völuspá:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This final passage, in particular, has caused wide differences of opinion as to the date and character of the poem. That the poet was heathen and not Christian seems almost beyond dispute; there is an intensity and vividness in almost every stanza which no archaizing Christian could possibly have achieved. On the other hand, the evidences of Christian influence are sufficiently striking to outweigh the arguments of Finnur Jonsson, Müllenhoff and others who maintain that the Voluspo is purely a product of heathendom. The roving Norsemen of the tenth century, very few of whom had as yet accepted Christianity, were nevertheless in close contact with Celtic races which had already been converted, and in many ways the Celtic influence was strongly felt. *It seems likely, then, that the Voluspo was the work of a poet living chiefly in Iceland, though possibly in the &quot;Western Isles,&quot; in the middle of the tenth century, a vigorous believer in the old gods, and yet with an imagination active enough to be **touched by the vague tales of a different religion** emanating from his neighbor Celts.*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source:[Völuspá, The Poetic Edda, tr. Henry Adams Bellows, Intr.](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe03.htm)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This suggests to me that, even though the author was decidedly not a Christian, it is entirely possible, and even likely, that the author used the Adam and Eve myth as inspiration for the Ask and Embla story. Note also that Ask and Embla were created out of trees (Ash and Elm), reminscient of the *Garden* of Eden but giving it an Icelandic spin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 17. Here the poem resumes its course after the interpolated section. Probably, however, something has been lost, for there is no apparent connection between the three giant-maids of stanza 8 and the three gods, Othin, Hönir and Lothur, who in stanza 17 go forth to create man and woman. The word &quot;three&quot; in stanzas 9 and 17 very likely confused some early reciter, or perhaps the compiler himself. Ask and Embla: ash and elm; Snorri gives them simply as the names of the first man and woman, but says that the gods made this pair out of trees.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source:[Völuspá, The Poetic Edda, tr.

Sinologist [Herrlee Glessner Creel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herrlee_Creel) says in [The Origins of Statecraft in China:](http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Origins_of_Statecraft_in_China.html?id=F5d1mQEACAAJ)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; For three thousand years it has been believed that from time **immemorial all Chinese revered T'ien 天, &quot;Heaven,&quot; as the highest deity,** and that this same deity was also known as Ti 帝 or Shang Ti 上帝. But the new materials that have become available in the present century, and especially the Shang inscriptions, make it evident that this was not the case. It appears rather that T'ien is not named at all in the Shang inscriptions, which instead refer with great frequency to Ti or Shang Ti. T'ien appears only with the Chou, and was apparently a Chou deity. After the conquest the Chou considered T'ien to be identical with the Shang deity Ti (or Shang Ti), much as the Romans identified the Greek Zeus with their Jupiter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in China this phrase **&quot;Son of Heaven&quot; should not be taken literally.** In [Heritage of China: Contemporary Perspectives on Chinese Civilization](http://books.google.com/books/about/Heritage_of_China.html?id=zm6Sm64y5CwC), it states:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The ruler soon bore a new title that was based on the legitimating concept of the Mandate of Heaven: the Son of Heaven. The term **was not taken in the literal sense to mean that the Chou king was descended from Heaven** and therefore divine, but it did convey the idea that the King had been chosen by Heaven. Just as lineage heads were patrimonially responsible to the Chou king, so too was he responsible, as a son, to Heaven, who could withdraw the mandate and confer it on a more deserving, that is, a more morally responsible, ruling house." />

According to the 百物語怪談会 Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai webpage [Kodama – The Tree Spirit][1],&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In ancient times, kodama were said to be kami, nature dieties that dwelled in trees. Some believed that kodama were not linked to a single tree but could move nimbly through the forest, traveling freely from tree to tree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it seems that the sounds of the forests were related to the kodama:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But they were also a sound. Echoes that reverberated through mountains and valleys were said to be kodama. The sound of a tree crashing in the woods was also said to be the plaintive cry of a kodama. (In modern times this mountain echo is associated with the yokai yamabiko and not with kodama).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In ancient times, their form was either considered to be invisible or indistinguishable from the trees themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The oldest known reference is from the 10th century CE (Heian period) in the Wamuryorui Jyusho (和名類聚抄; Japanese Names for Things; written 931 – 938 CE), this was a dictionary of sorts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  listed 古多万 as the Japanese word for spirits of the trees. Another Heian era book, Genji Monogatari (源氏物語; The Tale of Genji), uses木魂 to describe kodama as sort of tree-dwelling goblin. Genji Monogatari also uses the phrase “either oni or kami or kitsune or kodama,” showing that these four spirits were thought to be separate entities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;During the Edo era, the kodama became 'humanised' and even stated that they could change their form to be human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://hyakumonogatari.com/2012/08/05/kodama-the-tree-spirit/" />

So this is effectively saying &quot;the Earth gave birth to the mountains&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That same Wikipedia reference claims they were the &quot;[parthenogenetic][3] offspring of Gaia alone&quot;, which means there was no partner; they just happened.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not sure if there's another original source that mentions them, but this is what [Hesiod][4] had to say:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And Gaia (Earth) first bore starry Ouranos (Heaven), equal to herself,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Ourea (Mountains),&#xD;&#xA;&gt; graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphai who dwell amongst the glens of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Pontos (Sea), without sweet union of love.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That last phrase there is key. It appears to be applied to Pontos only, but since no partner is mentioned for the previous children either, I think we can assume it applies to them as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ourea&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.theoi.com/Protogenos/Ourea.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenogenesis&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hesiod/theogony.htm" />

Most texts that I can find refer to Elfland as being subterranean:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The fairyland of the ballad tradition similarly existed in a kind of wilderness, albiet one suffused in preternatural light. As already indicated, Thomas Rhymer's Elfland **was situated in some sort of subterranean locale** wherein 'he saw neither sun nor moon / But heard the roaring of the see'. Likewise, the enchanted wood in 'Tam Lin' lacked solar and lunar illumination: 'Seven days she tarried there/Saw neither sun nor meen'.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Frequent mention is made of the location of the home of the elves in the witch trials, virtually every example placing the fairies **beside or inside hills.** The trial of Lady Fowlis or Katherine Ross in 1590 reported that she 'wald gang in Hillis to speik the elf folk'. In 1615, Jonet Drever was convicted for the 'fostering of ane bairne in the hill of Westray to the fary folk, callit of hir guid nichbouris'.

This is back up by the else tended to operate at night:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The face of the country, too, might have some effect; as we should naturally attribute a less malicious disposition, and a less frightful appearance, to the **fays who glide by moon-light** through the oaks of Windsor, then those who haunt the solitary heaths and lofty mountains of the North. The fact at least is certain; and it has not escaped a late ingenious traveller, that the character of the Scottish Fairy is more harsh and terrific than that wish is ascribed to the elves of our sister kingdom.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A beautiful reason is assigned by Fletcher for the fays frequenting streams and fountains: He tells us of   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; A virtuous well, about whose flowery banks   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; The nimble-footed Fairies dance their rounds,   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; By the **pale moon-shine,** dipping oftentimes   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; Their stolen children, so to make them free   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; From dying flesh and dull mortality.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Faithful Shepherdess   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It is sometimes accounted unlucky to pass such places, without performing some ceremony to avert the displeasure of the elves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Book of Scottish Ballads, Etc.; Alexander Whitelaw; 438-439](https://books.google.com/books?id=si1YAAAAcAAJ)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

In every religion you can see that the number twelve is always present in main events or facts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;e.g.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Greek Mythology**: Labours of Hercules, the Dodecatheon and twelve Titans, according to Hesiod.&#xD;&#xA;* **Christianity**: The 12 Disciples of Christ&#xD;&#xA;* **Norse Mythology**: Odin had 12 sons&#xD;&#xA;* **Islam**:  There are twelve Imams, legitimate successors of the Islamic prophet.&#xD;&#xA;* **Judaism**: 12 tribes of Israel.&#xD;&#xA;* **Sumerian Mythology**: 12 Major Gods &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are way too many examples where 12 is used and I it's probably because `12` had a special place for ancient people, since the use of the [Duodecimal][1] and [Sexagesimal][2] systems was widespread at the time and it's actually the first systems used in arithmetics. I have found no reference (and I believe there isn't any) as to **why** it is deemed a special number in a religious essence, apart from the fact that it had many mathematical properties, such as being the first number with six divisors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The number 12 is a **highly respected and practical** number. It has **many factors for such a low number**, so it is one of the lowest easily-divisible numbers. Number 11 is not divisible, number 10 only has two factors (2 and 5) meaning that if you measure anything in tens, you can only divide it into either halves or pairs. Number 9 only divides into 3, number 8 only into 2 and 4, number 7 is a prime number with no factors, number 6 only breaks down into half or thirds, number 5 is a prime, you can only halve number 4 or 2, and 3 and 1 don't divide and are so small you wouldn't want to measure things in them, anyway. **Number 12, however, divides into 6, 4, 3 and 2, giving it a large number of practical uses where things have to be divided up into whole numbers, from calendars to clocks.** As a result of all these factors, mathematicians get excited about the number 12 and apparently, they always have done! For example, **Pythagoras, the classical mathematics genius, teacher, and leader of a pagan religious movement, taught that the number 12 had divine, profound mystical meaning.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Source: http://www.humanreligions.info/twelve.html#Maths&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal" />

He is also a human figure (although maybe with skills that could rival with those of the Dwarves) not a god.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   " />

It was a water&#xD;&#xA;&gt; world inhabited only by animals and creatures of the air who could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; survive without land.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Up above, the Sky World was quite different. Human-type beings lived&#xD;&#xA;&gt; there with infinite types of plants and animals to enjoy.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Sky World, there was a Tree of Life that was very special to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the people of the Sky World. They knew that it grew at the entrance to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the world below and forbade anyone to tamper with the Tree. One woman&#xD;&#xA;&gt; who was soon to give birth was curious about the Tree and convinced&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her brother to uproot the Tree.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Beneath the Tree was a great hole. The woman peered from the edge into&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the hole and suddenly fell off the edge. As she was falling she&#xD;&#xA;&gt; grasped at the edge and clutched in her hand some of the earth from&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Sky World. As she fell, the birds of the world below were&#xD;&#xA;&gt; disturbed and alerted to her distress. The birds responded and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; gathered a great many of their kind to break her fall and cradle her&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to the back of a great sea turtle. The creatures of the water believed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; that she needed land to live on, so they set about to collect some for&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her. They dove to the great depths of the world's oceans to gather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earth to make her a place to live. Many of the animals tried to gather&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the earth from the ocean floor, only the muskrat was successful. With&#xD;&#xA;&gt; only a small bit of earth brought onto turtle's back from his small&#xD;&#xA;&gt; paws, Turtle Island began to grow.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Sky Woman soon gave birth to a daughter on Turtle Island. The&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daughter grew fast. There were no man-beings on Turtle Island, but a&#xD;&#xA;&gt; being known as the West Wind married the daughter of Sky Woman.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Soon the daughter of Sky Woman gave birth to Twins. One was born the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; natural way, and he was called the Right-Handed Twin. The other was&#xD;&#xA;&gt; born in a way that caused the death of the mother. He was called the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Left-Handed Twin. When their mother died, their grandmother, Sky&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Woman, placed the fistful of earth that she grasped from the edge of&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the Sky World, and placed it on her daughter's grave. The earth&#xD;&#xA;&gt; carried special seeds from the Sky World that were nourished by the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earth over her daughter. So from the body of her daughter came the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sacred Tobacco, Strawberry and Sweetgrass. We call these Kionhekwa.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Life Givers.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Right and Left-Handed Twins were endowed with special creative&#xD;&#xA;&gt; powers. The Right-Handed Twin created gentle hills, beautiful smelling&#xD;&#xA;&gt; flowers, quiet brooks, butterflies and numerous creatures, plants and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; earth formations. His brother the Left-Handed Twin made snakes, thorns&#xD;&#xA;&gt; on rose bushes, thunder and lightning and other more disturbing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attributes of today's world. Together, they created man and his many&#xD;&#xA;&gt; attributes. The Right-Handed Twin believed in diplomacy and conflict&#xD;&#xA;&gt; resolution. The Left-Handed Twin believed in conflict as resolution.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; They were very different, but all that they created is an integral&#xD;&#xA;&gt; part of this Earth's Creation.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Their Grandmother, Sky Woman, now came to the end of her life. When&#xD;&#xA;&gt; she died, the Twins fought over her body and pulled it apart, throwing&#xD;&#xA;&gt; her head into the sky. As part of the Sky World, there her head&#xD;&#xA;&gt; remained to shine upon the world as Grandmother Moon. The Twins could&#xD;&#xA;&gt; not live together without fighting. They agreed to dwell in different&#xD;&#xA;&gt; realms of the earth. The Right-Handed Twin continued to live in the&#xD;&#xA;&gt; daylight and the Left-Handed Twin became a dweller of the night. Both&#xD;&#xA;&gt; of them continue their special duties to their Mother the Earth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, this doesn't tell us where the Sky People came from.  Is there another legend or story that tells us this?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Note: I realize that many Native American tribes have a shared mythos, so other tribes that share this story are also fair sources for an origin of the Sky People.&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/TheCreationStory-Iroquois.html" />

Thus he established by law that all dead men should&#xD;&#xA;be burned, and their belongings laid with them upon the pile, and&#xD;&#xA;the ashes be cast into the sea or buried in the earth.  Thus,&#xD;&#xA;said he, every one will come to Valhalla with the riches he had&#xD;&#xA;with him upon the pile; and he would also enjoy whatever he&#xD;&#xA;himself had buried in the earth.  For men of consequence a mound&#xD;&#xA;should be raised to their memory, and for all other warriors who&#xD;&#xA;had been distinguished for manhood a standing stone; which custom&#xD;&#xA;remained long after Odin's time.  On winter day there should be&#xD;&#xA;blood-sacrifice for a good year, and in the middle of winter for&#xD;&#xA;a good crop; and the third sacrifice should be on summer day, for&#xD;&#xA;victory in battle.  Over all Swithiod the people paid Odin a&#xD;&#xA;scatt or tax -- so much on each head; but he had to defend the&#xD;&#xA;country from enemy or disturbance, and pay the expense of the&#xD;&#xA;sacrifice feasts for a good year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [THE YNGLINGA SAGA, OR THE STORY OF THE YNGLING FAMILY FROM ODIN&#xD;&#xA;TO HALFDAN THE BLACK](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm).&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The logical conclusion, therefore, is that servants would be sacrificed in order to continue serving their master in the afterlife. How else could their master &quot;enjoy whatever he himself had buried in the earth&quot;?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another hint that the sacrificed slaves were intended as a burial gift can be found in the poem The Short Lay of Sigurth: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 68\. &quot;The door of the hall | shall strike not the heel  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Of the hero fair | with flashing rings,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; If hence my following | goes with him;  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Not mean our faring | forth shall be.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 69\. &quot;Bond-women five | shall follow him,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; And eight of my thralls, | well-born are they,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Children with me, | and mine they were  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; As gifts that Buthli | his daughter gave.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [SIGURTHARKVITHA EN SKAMMA](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/poe/poe28.htm).&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Lastly, I think it's interesting to mention that Ibn Fadlan's narrative may be  supported by archaeological finds: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ten Viking Age individuals from the northern Norwegian site at Flakstad were analysed for δ13C, δ15N and ancient mitochondrial DNA fragments. The material derives from both single and multiple burials with individuals treated in different ways. The genetic analyses show that the individuals buried together were unlikely to be maternally related, and stable isotope analyses suggest different strata of society. It is, therefore, suggested that slaves may have been offered as grave gifts at Flakstad. A comparison with the remaining population from single graves shows that the presumed slaves had a diet similar to that of the common population, whereas the high status individuals in multiple graves had a diet different from both slaves and the common population. The results provide an insight into the subsistence of different social groups in a Viking Age society, exposing unexpected patterns of living conditions and food distribution.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [Slaves as burial gifts in Viking Age Norway?

The four Yugas known as Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali together make up one Mahayuga, and a thousand Mahayugas make up one Kalpa or day of Brahma.  But in addition to being divided into 1000 Mahayugas, a Kalpa is also divided into fourteen Manvantaras, each of which is made up of about 71 Mahayugas.  We're currently living in the seventh Manvantara of the present Kalpa, known as the Vaivasvata Manavantara, and we're living in the 28th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we have some background, in [this chapter][1] of the Matsya Purana (an important Hindu scripture), various incarnations of Vishnu in the present Vaivasvata Manvantara.  But Kalki is only mentioned once, and that is in the current Kali Yuga.  [This excerpt][2] from the Skanda Purana says the same thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And we can find explicit references to how Kali Yugas have ended in the past.  In particular, [this chapter][3] of the famous Hindu epic the Mahabharata describes how Vishnu's incarnation Parashurama brought about the 20th Satya Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara by killing the kings of the world:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Even the great ascetic Rama, the hero worshipped by all heroes, that son of Jamadagni, of great fame, will die, without being contented (with the period of his life). **Rooting out all evils from the earth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in.** Having obtained unrivalled prosperity, no fault could be seen in him. His father having been slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any boast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With his bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already within the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen thousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a thousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging. Heroic warriors, with their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by the wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father.

Absolutely nothing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Then,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the beginning there was only Chaos. Then out of the void appeared Erebus, the unknowable place where death dwells, and Night. All else was empty, silent, endless, dark. Then, Love was born bringing along the beginning of order. From Love emerged Light, followed by Gaea, the earth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sup&gt;http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation/the_creation.html&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's one version. Another explanation is&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It all started when Chaos, Gaea (Earth) and Eros started sleeping with each other, leading to the Gods. So, in Greek mythology, the creation of the world starts with the creation of the different classes of Gods. In this instance, the term 'gods' refers to the characters that ruled the Earth (without necessarily possessing any divine attributes) until the 'real' Gods, the Olympians, came.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sup&gt;http://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/The_Creation_II/the_creation_ii.html&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are based in Hesiod's *Theogony*. I was able to find [an actual quote from it](http://www.theoi.com/greek-mythology/primeval-gods.html):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Declare to me from the beginning, you Mousai who dwell in the house of Olympos, and tell me which of them first came to be.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In truth at first Khaos (Air) came to be, but next wide-bosomed Gaia (Earth), the ever-sure foundation of all the deathless ones who hold the peaks of snowy Olympos, and dim Tartaros (the Pit) in the depth of the wide-pathed Earth, and Eros (Love), fairest among the deathless gods, who unnerves the limbs and overcomes the mind and wise counsels of all gods and all men within them. From Khaos (Air) came forth Erebos (Darkness) and black Nyx (Night); but of Nyx (Night) were born Aither (Light) and Hemera (Day), whom she conceived and bore from union in love with Erebos. And Gaia (Earth) first bore starry Ouranos (Heaven), equal to herself, to cover her on every side, and to be an ever-sure abiding-place for the blessed gods. And she brought forth long Ourea (Mountains), graceful haunts of the goddess Nymphai who dwell amongst the glens of the hills. She bore also the fruitless deep with his raging swell, Pontos (Sea), without sweet union of love.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But afterwards he [Gaia, Earth] lay with Ouranos (Heaven) and bare deep-swirling Okeanos, Koios and Krios and Hyperion and Iapetos, Theia and Rhea, Themis and Mnemosyne and gold-crowned Phoibe and lovely Tethys. After them was born Kronos the wily.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -- Hesiod, Theogony 115&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aristophanes had a slightly different version:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; At the beginning there was only Khaos (Air), Nyx (Night), dark Erebos (Darkness), and deep Tartaros (Hell's Pit). Ge (Earth), Aer (Air) and Ouranos (Heaven) had no existence. Firstly, black-winged Nyx (Night) laid a germless egg in the bosom of the infinite deeps of Erebos (Darkness), and from this, after the revolution of long ages, sprang the graceful Eros (Love) with his glittering golden wings, swift as the whirlwinds of the tempest. He mated in deep Tartaros (Hell-Pit) with dark Khaos (Air), winged like himself, and thus hatched forth our race [the birds], which was the first to see the light. That of the Immortals did not exist until Eros had brought together all the ingredients of the world, and from their marriage Ouranos (Heaven), Okeanos (Ocean), Ge (Earth) and the imperishable race of blessed gods (Theoi) sprang into being.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; -- Aristophanes, Birds 685&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In both cases, Gaea is understood to be a personification of the Earth; the same goes for Chaos, Erebus/Erebos, Eros, and many of the others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For information on just *how* Gaea begat her children, see http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/650/how-were-the-first-children-of-gaia-conceived." />

The Titan Phoibe doesn't actually seem to be associated with the moon, the confusion comes from Selene being often nicknamed Phoebe (i. e. *'bright'*). Phoibe was apparently a prophetess Titan-goddess and as such is supposed to have held the Oracle of Delphi at some point. From the first line of Aeschylus's [*Eumenides*](http://classics.mit.edu/Aeschylus/eumendides.html):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;THE PYTHIAN PRIESTESS  &#xD;&#xA;First, in this prayer, of all the gods I name   &#xD;&#xA;The prophet-mother Earth; and Themis next,   &#xD;&#xA;Second who sat-for so with truth is said-   &#xD;&#xA;On this her mother's shrine oracular.   &#xD;&#xA;Then by her grace, who unconstrained allowed,   &#xD;&#xA;There sat thereon another child of Earth-   &#xD;&#xA;Titanian Phoebe.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA; - Hecate. Now Hecate is something else I think. As one can see on her [Theoi](http://www.theoi.com/Khthonios/Hekate.html) page, the different sources tend to contradict each other on her parentage, descendance, attributions etc. leading some scholars to think that Hecate was in fact a goddess foreign to the Greek Pantheon that was only added later (and well integrated thanks to Hesiod *Hymn to Hecate* and the place he gave her in the *Theogony*). See for instance what Sarah Johnston says about it in [*Restless Deads*](https://books.google.de/books?id=qbihKIJw_OUC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA205#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Let us go back further, to Hecate's place of origin. There is general agreement that this was Caria, in southwestern Asia Minor, which is supported by the fact that by the Hellenistic period her precinct in Lagina was the largest of all the precincts there (in constrast, in all of Greece, only Aegina seems to have had any significant sanctuary devoted wholly to Hecate).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Caria being in southwestern Anatolia.&#xD;&#xA;Similarly (from the list I mentioned earlier), [Pasiphae](http://www.theoi.com/Titan/Pasiphae.html) seems to have been the cretan moon-goddess and [Bendis](http://www.theoi.com/Thrakios/Bendis.html) the one from Thrace.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The specific reason why Hecate was associated with the moon seems a bit complex. Originally, in Caria, Hecate seems to have been a fairly generic mother Goddess. Even in Hesiod's *Theogony* she is presented as having dominion over basically everything. According to Sarah Johnston in *[Hekate Soteira: A Study of Hekate's Role in the Chaldean Oracles and Related Literature](https://books.google.de/books?ei=9FlUVd7JLce5UbrxgcgH&amp;id=pyp-AAAAMAAJ)* (which I haven't been able to find and thus read so I might be misrepresenting her idea here), the association came relatively late (1st Century AD) from the fact that at some point Hecate was seen as a &quot;*liminal*&quot; goddess, an intermediary between two worlds (hence also probably the association between Hecate and witchcraft), which is a quality that was supposedly shared by the Moon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;___&#xD;&#xA;So to summarize, the difference between Selene and Artemis is that one *is*  the moon while the other is just associated with it, and on top of that one is a Titan while the other is an Olympian; Phoebe has nothing to do with the moon; and the others are foreign/regional goddesses integrated *a posteriori*  into the Greek Pantheon." />

The four Yugas known as Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali together make up one Mahayuga, and a thousand Mahayugas make up one Kalpa or day of Brahma.  But in addition to being divided into 1000 Mahayugas, a Kalpa is also divided into fourteen Manvantaras, each of which is made up of about 71 Mahayugas.  We're currently living in the seventh Manvantara of the present Kalpa, known as the Vaivasvata Manavantara, and we're living in the 28th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we have some background, in [this chapter][1] of the Matsya Purana (an important Hindu scripture), various incarnations of Vishnu in the present Vaivasvata Manvantara are described.  But Kalki is only mentioned once, and that is in the current Kali Yuga.  [This excerpt][2] from the Skanda Purana says the same thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And we can find explicit references to how Kali Yugas have ended in the past.  In particular, [this chapter][3] of the famous Hindu epic the Mahabharata describes how Vishnu's incarnation Parashurama brought about the 20th Satya Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara by killing the kings of the world:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Even the great ascetic Rama, the hero worshipped by all heroes, that son of Jamadagni, of great fame, will die, without being contented (with the period of his life). **Rooting out all evils from the earth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in.** Having obtained unrivalled prosperity, no fault could be seen in him. His father having been slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any boast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With his bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already within the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen thousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a thousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging. Heroic warriors, with their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by the wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father. And Rama, on that occasion, slew ten thousand Kshatriyas with his axe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, as far as I know there was only one other occasion where Vishnu took a Kalki incarnation.  The Kalki incarnation was named Pramati, and he seems to have lived in the Swayambhuva Manvantara, the first Manvantara of the present Kalpa.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the way, if you're interested in those lists of Vaivasvata Manvantara incarnations found in the Matsya and Skanda Puranas, I've posted a few questions about them on Hinduism.SE, [here][4], [here][5], and [here][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.com/books?id=nckrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%2224th%20treta%22&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.indianscriptures.com/Content/Articles/PDFs/27478/62f_chapter_19_2.pdf#toolbar=0&amp;pagemode=none&amp;view=FitBH&amp;page=1%22&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://Even%20the%20great%20ascetic%20Rama,%20the%20hero%20worshipped%20by%20all%20heroes,%20that%20son%20of%20Jamadagni,%20of%20great%20fame,%20will%20die,%20without%20being&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7192/36&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7194/36&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7221/36" />

These were Spurius Larcius and Titus Herminius, both famous for their birth and their deeds. With these he endured the peril of the first rush and the stormiest moment of the battle.

At the same time it was not easy for them even to come near him, since he had the river as a defence on the right and left, and in front of him a heap of arms and dead bodies.

The story tracks his search for a fair maiden he sees in a dream, eventually bringing him to Britain, where he finds the lady he seeks. Learning that he has been replaced as emperor, he rushes back to Rome with his newly-wedded wife.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does this story appear in Roman folklore? It somewhat corresponds to historical events involving Magnus Maximus, but other parts seem to be embellished. Also, Welsh folklore typically involves Welsh heroes and nobles; it seems rather odd to have a legend told from a Roman perspective. There were Romans in the south of Britain at the time (including Magnus Maximus, of course), and I suspect that they could have influenced the story, but I'm not sure. That would have been hundreds of years before the Welsh tales were collected in their medieval form, but they could have been different originally." />

Then the young man's sixteenth birthday approaches (or was it some other day symbolizing the coming of age?), and Apollo wants to give him the best present a mortal has ever had. But he is neither powerful enough to grant the best, nor wise enough to know what the best is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apollo then goes to Zeus and asks him to give his friend the best present on his special day. Zeus agrees and Apollo tells his friend, both awaiting the day with happy apprehension. But then, on the birthday, the young boy is struck by lightning. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apollo is very angry and demands an explanation of Zeus. The explanation: Zeus killed the boy on the happiest day of his life, before he had met the sorrow of the drudging adult routine. This was the best present a mortal could have. Apollo understands this and mourns his friend. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have forgotten the name of the boy. Upon checking, it's not one of the usual suspects (Hyacinth, Cyparis). I also don't know any more where I have read it, although it's not in the thick Kuhn edition of the Greek myths in my parents' home. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Does anybody recognize the myth? Can you give me more info about the name of the boy, and a source where it is recorded?" />

These names number more than sixty, but most generally make reference to a &quot;Wildman of the woods.&quot; In the 1920s, Canadian journalist J.W. Burns coined the term *Sasquatch* as a common denominator for the myriad of native names. ***Sasquatch* derives directly from the word &quot;*sésquac*.&quot;** The original word, in the dialect of the Stó:lò dialect of the Halkomelem language, is used by the Coast Sasqu Indians of the Frase Valley and parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This](http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/trivia10.html) translates &quot;sésquac&quot; as &quot;wild man.&quot; [This](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=584) has a passage curiously similar to the one in Meldrum's book:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The term &quot;sasquatch&quot; is an anglicized derivative of the word &quot;Sésquac&quot;, meaning &quot;wild man&quot;. The original word, in the Stó:lõ dialect of the Halkomelem language, is used by the Coast Salish Indians of the Fraser Valley and parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Indian tribes across North America have a total of more than sixty different terms for the sasquatch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strangely enough, Meldrum is not listed in the [&quot;Useful Links&quot;](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=588) section, though that should not be confused with sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A fairly detailed list of name related to the creature is given by [Ontario Sasquatch](http://www.ontariosasquatch.com/#/canadian-names-pg-1/4522683510). Most related words are simply translated as &quot;Sasquatch&quot; (or &quot;male Sasquatch&quot; or &quot;female Sasquatch&quot;), though the word &quot;Suhsq’uhtch&quot;, used by the Coast Salish people, is translated as &quot;men, covered with dark fur, more than eight feet tall, who leave footprints about twenty inches long.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The Cowicham people gave the creatures the name &quot;Thumquas.&quot;](http://www.joejack.com/sasquatch.html). Interestingly enough, the Cowicham people do speak [Halkomelem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halkomelem), though Wikipedia describes them as speaking a branch distinct from that of the Stó:lò.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Mythology&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the most tantalizing sources I could find about the mythology surrounding the name was from the article [&quot;Retired principal puts out second pre-teen novel&quot;, by Clyde Woolman (*Comox Valley Record*)](http://www.comoxvalleyrecord.com/entertainment/224265911.html) (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It at least seems reasonably clear that the origin of the English word came from an Agassiz teacher in the 1920s **who heard the term sasq'ets from the Sts'ailes (Chehalis) people) who live in the area, which described a sollicum, a being of the natural and supernatural world.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The word &quot;sollicum&quot; does not seem to appear anywhere else related the Chehalis mythology - at least, nowhere that I could find.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[A page on SasquatchSighting.ca](http://sasquatchsighting.ca/the-legend-of-saskakaua-creek) claims (emphasis mine),&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The legends of Sasquatch have been part of the Chehalis tribe for centuries. In fact, their oral history says that sasquatch are their mortal enemies.** And in their St:olo dialect the word Saskakaua roughly means “Place of the Wild Men”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*The Sunday Journal and Star*](http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ReportImages/article_bc_1934_NE_large.gif) says much the same thing. In the lower left-hand corner,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The existence of a troglodytic race inhabiting the mountains of British Columbia in many of the vast caves  is a tribal legend among the Chehalis Indians and those of the Skwah Reservation, near Chilliwack, in the Harrison Lake district, about a hundred miles east of Vancouver. Among the Indians the race has been known for centuries by the name &quot;Sasquatch,&quot; or hairy men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article later says that legends date back &quot;at least three generations&quot; (this was written in 1934).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This](http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/sasq-ets.htm) also says&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The creature has a spiritual quality for the Chehalis--the spiritual and physical are closely connected in First Nations beliefs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also says that First Nations people all over have legends based around the creature, and that rock paintings appear to have been made of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was not able to find anything about &quot;Thumquas,&quot; unfortunately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One a side note, [the Quinalt people have a legend about a being known as &quot;Glue-Keek&quot;](http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/quinalt.htm). A Quinalt woman, Harvest Moon, tells the story (also given [here](http://www.sasquatchchronicles.com/bigfoot-believers/):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Harvest Moon is familiar with several native legends about Bigfoot. The Quinault woman works as a storyteller at the Lake Quinault Lodge and other resorts along the coast during the summer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; She tells the story of the Glue-Keek monster she learned from a Lummi elder and its ties to the creation of mosquitos. The monster frightens tribal members and prevents them from hunting and gathering food.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; His legs were as big as tree trunks, she said while swaying her hips and making arm and hand gestures during a recent storytelling presentation at the Lake Quinault Lodge. His skin was as tough as leather and his eyes had a hypnotic glow to them. The monster started chasing the women through the berry patch. He took his huge, big feet, knocking over every basket of berries, wasting them on the ground.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; According to the legend, warriors from various tribes gathered and vowed to kill the monster. They dug a hole, tricked Glue-Keek into falling into it and burned him. As Glue-Keek perished, he swore he would return to drink the villagers blood. As his ashes ascended into the air, they transformed into mosquitos." />

It's bad enough to kill someone else, worse to kill them over the quality of sacrifices and God's acceptance of them, worse still to kill your own brother, and then you add in the fact that Cain killed one of only four humans alive at the time.

The following people would have been born in Cain's lifespan: Seth, Enosh, Kenan, Mahalalel, Jared, Enoch, and Methusaleh. This is not counting the other sons and daughters *each* of them had. Including Adam, incidentally. To get a rough, lower-bound estimate for the number of descendants of Seth alive in Cain's time, I'm going to assume that each son had five children, three of whom are sons.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This leads to **at least 1215** people alive in Cain's lifetime who would have had reason to find him and kill him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That's a lower bound. Adam and Eve also had &quot;other sons and daughters&quot; (which would bump up the population to at least 4000), and Cain himself had progeny. We're talking at least **5000** people living before Cain died, a significant portion of which might want to kill him. It is also quite possible that Adam and Eve already had other children by the time they had Cain, and in either case, Cain was probably smart enough to realize that there would be other people that would want to kill him, even if they hadn't been born yet. Hence, his fear is justified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Now that's a phrase you won't hear often regarding human lifespans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Given the lack of a prohibition against incest, which didn't appear until Moses' time&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, I'm going to assume that the daughters very well might have married brothers/cousins. It's easiest to leave them out of the calculation (and I'm calculating a *lower* bound anyway).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; [Leviticus 18:8-18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2018:8-18:18&amp;version=NIV) and [Leviticus 20:11-21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=leviticus%2020:11-20:21&amp;version=NIV)" />

He goes on at great length about the time of Arthur, describing some of his later exploits after defeating &quot;a pagan people from Angla&quot; with the help of Hoel, king of Brittany:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Soon after this struggle he subdued the Scots and, changing the direction of his campaign, the war-like Irish. He overcame all nations in the expeditions he led. He brought into subjection both the Norwegians who lived far across the broad seas and the Danes whom he sought out with his dreaded fleet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;He brought the people of France under his rule after killing Frollo, to whose care the country had been committed by those in power at Rome. He even fought and defeated the Romans themselves when they were preparing a campaign against his kingdom. He killed the procurator Lucius Hiberius, who had become the colleague of Emperor Leo and had come on the Senate's orders to bring the French territories back under its authority.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;During this time the faithless and foolhardy guardian of our realm, Modred, had begun to take over the kingdom and to carry on an unlawful love affair with the king's wife. The king, it is said, had entrusted the kingdom and the queen to Modred's care when about to leave on a campaign against his enemies overseas. When the report of this great crime reached his ears, he gave up his intended campaign and returned home, landing with many thousands of men. He attacked his nephew and drove him abroad in flight. There this man of treachery gathered Saxon troops from all quarters and began a battle against his prince. But he was tricked by the evil race on whom he had relied in his large enterprise, and he was killed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And, of course, after being taken to Avalon soon after being wounded during the battle in which he killed his nephew,&#xD;&#xA;&gt;! Arthur died.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Merlin then talks about how &quot;the two sons of Modred&quot; fought each other for the crown and killed each other, which made the time ripe for Arthur's nephew, Constantine, to become king, shortly after Arthur's death.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Merlin is then interrupted by retainers, and never (it appears) finishes his story - if he intended to say any more, that is.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, Arthur's empire did not last. Did Geoffrey of Monmouth ever elaborate on how long it lasted?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a follow-up question, does he specify why it crumbled (though I think the answer is rather clear)? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;Supposedly, the story is also written in Geoffrey's *Historia Regum Britanniae*, though I have not yet read it.&lt;/sup&gt;" />

In [Herodotus, Book II](http://perseus.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/GreekScience/hdtbk2.html):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Chapter 90**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [1] Anyone, Egyptian or foreigner, known to have been carried off by a crocodile or drowned by the river itself, must by all means be embalmed and wrapped as attractively as possible and buried in a sacred coffin by the people of the place where he is cast ashore;  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; [2] none of his relatives or friends may touch him, but his body is considered something more than human, and is handled and buried by the priests of the Nile themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aaron Cheak, of the University of Philosophical Research writes more on the topic in an article titled: [&quot;Waters Animating and Annihilating: Apotheosis by Drowning in the Greek Magical Papyri&quot;](http://www.aaroncheak.com/waters-animating/) (Yes, sketchy-sounding name aside, the [Greek Magical Papyri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Magical_Papyri) are a real thing).  He asserts that this apotheosis by drowning was due to the connection to the death and ressurection of Osiris:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Only later, from the New Kingdom through to the late period, were the drowned increasingly regarded as sacred. This is due chiefly to the increasing significance of the role of Osiris, for whom drowning becomes instrumental to his revivification and deification. As Hopfner observes: “only after death by drowning could he [Osiris] become a god.” It is thus the myth of Osiris—and more significantly his death and resurrection at the hands of his enemy, Seth-Typhon—that underpins the motif of apotheosis by drowning that we meet in the magical papyri.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also worth mentioning, there is one significant example of a drowning in the Nile leading to a good and proper Roman state deification, complete with widespread cult.  [Antinous](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antinous#Deification_and_the_cult_of_Antinous), a lover of Emperor Hadrian, died by downing in the Nile.  Emperor Hadrian was devasted, and, in an unprecented move (for someone not in the ruling family), Hadrian deified him.  His cult spread to at least 70 cities, and at least 115 scultures of him are known to survive today.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The first blog linked in your question seems to have conflated these two somewhat, although I didn't really give it a thorough read." />

The ballgame was called tlaxtli or tlachtli. The court consisted of two walls with some twenty or thirty feet of distance between them and each was up to forty or fifty feet in length. The floor and walls were heavily plastered, the latter having some one and a half estados [nearly ten feet] in height. In the middle of the court was a line made especially for the game; and in the middle of the walls, halfway down the playing stretch, were two stones like millstones perforated in the middle, facing each other, and they each had holes wide enough that the ball could fit into each of them. And whoever placed the ball there won the game. They did not play with their hands but hit the ball with their flanks. For playing they wore gloves on their hands and a leather apron on their flanks to hit the ball (Sahagún 1938, II.viii.10, pp. 297-298).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# The Game's Role in the Plot&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just to summarise, the general plot of the Popol Vuh is one of a creation myth. It tells the story of how the gods created the worlds, the animals, and of the god's several attempts to create humans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important thing to note is that the reason behind the failure of the gods several attempts to create humans is that their attempts could not speak the names of the gods (e.g. know of them or worship them). Here's an example of this (this passage accounts why just creating animals was insufficient):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Speak therefore our names. Worship  us, for we are your Mother and your Father. Say this, therefore: ‘Huracan, Youngest Thunderbolt, and Sudden Thunderbolt, Heart of Sky and Heart of Earth, Framer and Shaper, She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons.’ Speak! Call upon us! Worship us!” they were told.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; But they did not succeed. They did not speak like people. They only squawked and chattered and roared. Their speech was unrecognizable, for each cried out in a&#xD;&#xA;different way.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;When they heard this, the Framer and the Shaper said, “Their speech did not&#xD;&#xA;&gt;turn out well.”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt;And again they said to each other:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “They were not able to speak our names. We are their Framer and their Shaper.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This is not good,” said She Who Has Borne Children and He Who Has Begotten Sons to&#xD;&#xA;&gt; each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([the online version of Allen J. Christenson's translation][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Xibalba (the underworld) doesn't appear until after three failed creation attempts (the second and third attempts failed for the same reason as the first creation attempt). They first appear to oppose the fathers of the twins, &quot;One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu,&quot; who, it is important to note, were &quot;born to Xpiyacoc and Xmucane&quot; (two of the seven gods who created the world) ([Christenson][3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “What is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping about and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall come to play ball, and we&#xD;&#xA;&gt; shall defeat them. They have simply failed to honor us. They have neither honor nor&#xD;&#xA;&gt; respect. Certainly they act arrogantly here over our heads,” said therefore all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; those of Xibalba.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Christenson][3])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should become clear that the lords of Xibalba are an opposing force to the creation god(desses). Not only are they the lords of death, but they, like the lords of creation, also want recognition from humans. As explained in the online book [*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][1]&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (which uses a different translation of the Popol Vuh):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We have here a contest between opposing forces, since those of Xibalbá cannot tolerate that &quot; 'anyone greater than they, or any having greater power, should exist,' they all said unanimously.&quot; From this passage it is seen that the organization of the false gods is similar to that of the true since, like the latter, the false gods compose a sevenfold entity whose components must get together and reach decisions by a unanimity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, when the Lords of Xibalba are defeated, their power is restricted, paving the way for the creation gods and goddesses to create humans: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; “Very well. Here then is our word that we declare to you. Hearken all&#xD;&#xA;&gt; you of Xibalba; for never again will you or your posterity be great.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Your offerings also will never again be great. They will henceforth be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; reduced to croton sap. No longer will clean blood be yours. Unto you&#xD;&#xA;&gt; will be given only worn-out griddles and pots, only flimsy and brittle&#xD;&#xA;&gt; things.&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus began their devastation, the ruin of their being called upon in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; worship. Their glory was not great in the past, for they wanted only&#xD;&#xA;&gt; conflict with the people of ancient times. **Surely they were not true&#xD;&#xA;&gt; gods.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From the plot perspective, the game &quot;ball&quot; is simply a competition to resolve the conflict, and the story wouldn't be much different if they played chess or another game.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Just to clarify the plot: One Hunahpu and Seven Hunahpu are defeated by Xibalba, but their sons learn to play ball, go to Xibalba, and defeat the Lords of Xibalba. Afterwords, humans are finally created.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# The Symbolic Interpretation of the Game&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, another way of looking at the game is as a symbol representing the sky. From [*Esotericism of the Popol Vuh*][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Besides symbolizing the sun's relative position in the order of its rising and its daily trajectory, Hunahpú and Ixbalamqué, playing alone for a long time on opposite sides of the court, represent the position of the sun and the moon at opposing solstices, just as this continues to be depicted on Chortí altars. All this unmistakably reflects a gradual progress in astronomic and cosmogonic knowledge. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Popol Vuh is the only American source to speak of the origin of the ball game and place it in time. Not only does it tell us of the game's ethnological antiquity, it also explains its symbolism. It in fact establishes a parallel between the ball players and the solar gods, which from the angles of the universe — to employ the phraseology of the Chumayel manuscript — meet in the center, in this case in the ball court, where they can convert themselves into two and even four persons with no loss of their theogonic individuality, at once a unity and a multiplicity. During the ball game they wear their resplendent ceremonial gear — that is, they exhibit their insignia as solar deities. Two by two they come from the eastern and western sectors of the cosmos and, meeting in the center, forge themselves into the individuality of Heart of Heaven. This fusion of a number of forms under &quot;one single head,&quot; as the Chortís say, is expressed in the principal rule of the game which is that the players can touch the ball only with their body but never with their heads, feet, or arms; each time this happens a point is given the other team. The continual contact of two or four bodies with a single ball makes clear the monotheistic principle whereby the deity integrates itself through the union of its hypostases. This idea is objectified in the group of ball players unable to use their heads or extremities since the ball — the symbol of the Star or Sun god — is alternatively the head of each. This figure of a single-headed god having many bodies is characteristic of Maya thought. We need only to remember Oxlahun-oc (&quot;it of the thirteen feet&quot;), who is mentioned in the Chilam Balam of Chumayel. The motion of the ball imitates the trajectory of the sun, a figure that the Chortí actors also reproduce in their dramatization of this part of the Popol Vuh. Besides this, the Quiché codex represents the descent of god-Seven from the Center of Heaven to the center of the earth by the solar bird which, coming down from on high, &quot;came to see them play.&quot; As said, in Chortí religious allegory the bird of prey, which is the mask, nahual, or messenger of the deity of Heaven, descends vertically to the center of the earth — like the sun's rays — when the daystar goes through the zenith, symbolizing the descent of divine grace. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This interpretation lends a new interpretation to the text: Xibalba, the &quot;Lords of the subterrene regions&quot; ([*Esotericism*][1]) are in conflict with the lords of the sky (the creators of the world) over power over the living world. The punishment of the Lords of Xibalba (&quot;you... shall no longer be allowed to play ball.&quot;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) reflects that Xibalba is restricted to a subteranian sphere, and that the power of death is limited. This may be one of the reasons why the gods can then create humans who &quot;can speak their name.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, we don't know enough to know without a doubt the real symbolism behind the ball game&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The conquistadors deliberately supressed indiginous culture when they conquored central america, and only four written mayan documents remain. It's impossible to understate the destruction that these cultures faced, and we are very fortunate that texts like the Popol Vuh still exist.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; I am continuously amazed at the quality of sources on mythology available online. Why would anyone want to read wikipedia?  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; This line does not occur in the Christenson translation, but the Lords of Xibalba still faced severe restrictions on their power.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; There is disagreement about the meaning of the ball game.  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; A good account of the translation can be found [on JStor (behind a paywall)][2].

More specifically, according to Hesiod the Titans, lead by [Cronos][2], castrated [Uranus][3] (personification of the sky) at the behest of [Gaia][4] (personification of the earth): &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 147-163) And again, three other sons were born of Earth and Heaven, great and doughty beyond telling, Cottus and Briareos and Gyes, presumptuous children. From their shoulders sprang an hundred arms, not to be approached, and each had fifty heads upon his shoulders on their strong limbs, and irresistible was the stubborn strength that was in their great forms. For of all the children that were born of Earth and Heaven, these were the most terrible, and they were hated by their own father from the first.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And he used to hide them all away in a secret place of Earth so soon as each was born, and would not suffer them to come up into the light: **and Heaven rejoiced in his evil doing. But vast Earth groaned within, being straitened, and she made the element of grey flint and shaped a great sickle, and told her plan to her dear sons. And she spoke, cheering them, while she was vexed in her dear heart:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 164-166) **'My children, gotten of a sinful father, if you will obey me, we should punish the vile outrage of your father; for he first thought of doing shameful things.'**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 167-169) So she said; but fear seized them all, and none of them uttered a word. But great Cronos the wily took courage and answered his dear mother:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 170-172) `Mother, I will undertake to do this deed, for I reverence not our father of evil name, for he first thought of doing shameful things.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 173-175) So he said: and vast Earth rejoiced greatly in spirit, and set and hid him in an ambush, and put in his hands a jagged sickle, and revealed to him the whole plot.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 176-206) And Heaven came, bringing on night and longing for love, and he lay about Earth spreading himself full upon her (7).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Then the son from his ambush stretched forth his left hand and in his right took the great long sickle with jagged teeth, and swiftly lopped off his own father's members and cast them away to fall behind him. And not vainly did they fall from his hand**; for all the bloody drops that gushed forth Earth received, and as the seasons moved round she bare the strong Erinyes and the great Giants with gleaming armour, holding long spears in their hands and the Nymphs whom they call Meliae (8) all over the boundless earth. And so soon as he had cut off the members with flint and cast them from the land into the surging sea, they were swept away over the main a long time: and a white foam spread around them from the immortal flesh, and in it there grew a maiden. First she drew near holy Cythera, and from there, afterwards, she came to sea-girt Cyprus, and came forth an awful and lovely goddess, and grass grew up about her beneath her shapely feet. Her gods and men call Aphrodite, and the foam-born goddess and rich-crowned Cytherea, because she grew amid the foam, and Cytherea because she reached Cythera, and Cyprogenes because she was born in billowy Cyprus, and Philommedes (9) because sprang from the members. And with her went Eros, and comely Desire followed her at her birth at the first and as she went into the assembly of the gods. This honour she has from the beginning, and this is the portion allotted to her amongst men and undying gods, -- the whisperings of maidens and smiles and deceits with sweet delight and love and graciousness.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; (ll. 207-210) But these sons whom be begot himself great Heaven used to call Titans (Strainers) in reproach, for he said that they strained and did presumptuously a fearful deed, and that vengeance for it would come afterwards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Theogony of Hesiod, translated by Hugh G.

In every religion you can see that the number twelve is always present in main events or facts:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;e.g.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* **Greek Mythology**: Labours of Hercules, the Dodecatheon and twelve Titans, according to Hesiod.&#xD;&#xA;* **Christianity**: The 12 Disciples of Christ&#xD;&#xA;* **Norse Mythology**: Odin had 12 sons&#xD;&#xA;* **Islam**:  There are twelve Imams, legitimate successors of the Islamic prophet.&#xD;&#xA;* **Judaism**: 12 tribes of Israel.&#xD;&#xA;* **Sumerian Mythology**: 12 Major Gods &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are way too many examples where 12 is used and I it's probably because `12` had a special place for ancient people, since the use of the [Duodecimal][1] and [Sexagesimal][2] systems was widespread at the time and it's actually the first systems used in arithmetics. I have found no reference (and I believe there isn't any) as to **why** it is deemed a special number in a religious essence, apart from the fact that it had many mathematical properties, such as being the first number with six divisors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The number 12 is a **highly respected and practical** number. It has **many factors for such a low number**, so it is one of the lowest easily-divisible numbers. Number 11 is not divisible, number 10 only has two factors (2 and 5) meaning that if you measure anything in tens, you can only divide it into either halves or pairs. Number 9 only divides into 3, number 8 only into 2 and 4, number 7 is a prime number with no factors, number 6 only breaks down into half or thirds, number 5 is a prime, you can only halve number 4 or 2, and 3 and 1 don't divide and are so small you wouldn't want to measure things in them, anyway. **Number 12, however, divides into 6, 4, 3 and 2, giving it a large number of practical uses where things have to be divided up into whole numbers, from calendars to clocks.** As a result of all these factors, mathematicians get excited about the number 12 and apparently, they always have done! For example, **Pythagoras, the classical mathematics genius, teacher, and leader of a pagan religious movement, taught that the number 12 had divine, profound mystical meaning.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[The Divine Number 12][3]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duodecimal&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexagesimal&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.humanreligions.info/twelve.html#Maths" />

I've seen many modern books wrongly claiming that hope did escape the box and, despite all evil that was spread throughout the land, people still hoped that better days would soon come. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hesiod is the one that refers to the box (it was not a box actually, but more like a jar) and claims that Pandora (actually referring to women) is the root of all evil, because she would hurt the man with her beauty and lies.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;For from her is the descent of female women       &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;a great pain for mortals, living with men, &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;companions not of destructive Poverty but of Plenty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Theogony][2]&lt;sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When Pandora opened the box, all evil escaped it, but Pandora (under Zeus' will) held hope inside the jar by closing the lid. Isiodus doesn't say why hope stayed into the jar, but one (judging from Isiodus' view on women) can imply that  he meant by that, that the men would have no hope against women, for without her, they would die alone, but with her, they'd have to withstand their cunning nature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Judging by this, which is how Hesiod closes [Theogony][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Theogony][4]&lt;sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an angry Zeus decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given.

He could not remember how or where he had mislaid it. Loki's thoughts went toward Thrym, that stupid Giant who yet had cunning streaks in him. Thor, who had lost the hammer that he had sworn never to let out of his sight, did not know what to do.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;But Loki thought it would be worth while to see if Thrym knew anything about it. He went first to Asgard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt; [The Children of Odin][2]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By having a discussion with Thrym, the hammer's location is identified:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Ha, Loki, Shape-changer,&quot; said Thrym, &quot;you are there!

Thor could hardly restrain himself from springing up and seizing it from the Giant. But Loki was able to keep him still. Thrym brought over the hammer and put the handle into the hands of her whom he thought was his bride. Thor's hands closed on his hammer. Instantly he stood up. The veil fell off him. His countenance and his blazing eyes were seen by all. He struck one blow on the wall of the house. Down it crashed. Then Thor went striding out of the ruin with Loki beside him, while within the Giants bellowed as the roof and walls fell down on them.

Since it was feared that there would be a fraud in who would get selected, the people is charge of the draw would throb the lottery, until the names of the judges came out, due to that movement of the lottery jar.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Οι προσωνυμίες της Αθηνάς][1]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The primary importance therefore of **Pallas** is the motion that someone does in a legatee to achieve the draw. And **Pallas** means the custodian of the draw, the custodian of the Republic. And **Pallas** Athena was primarily the protector of democratic Athens.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Οι προσωνυμίες της Αθηνάς][1]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apollodorus informs us about Pallas, Athena's friend:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;They say that when Athena was born she was brought up by Triton,  who had a daughter Pallas; and that both girls practised the arts of war, but that once on a time they fell out; and when Pallas was about to strike a blow, Zeus in fear interposed the aegis, and Pallas, being startled, looked up, and so fell wounded by Athena. And being exceedingly grieved for her, Athena made a wooden image in her likeness, and wrapped the aegis, which she had feared, about the breast of it, and set it up beside Zeus and honored it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[Apollodorus 3.12.3][2]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;More than one interpretations might be true in their own aspect. In the aspect of mythology, Apollodorus' version is correct. But in the aspect of reality (why the people who worshipped Athena named her **Pallas** and why the had to find a myth that gave her that name), Kontos Aleksandros' analysis might be true as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://lykomidis.wordpress.com/2010/01/17/%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CF%80%CF%81%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%89%CE%BD%CF%85%CE%BC%CE%AF%CE%B5%CF%82-%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82-%CE%B8%CE%B5%CE%AC%CF%82-%CE%B1%CE%B8%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%AC%CF%82/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus3.html" />

There were variations of the Dodecatheon tracing back in older times:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; While the number was fixed at twelve, there was considerable variation as to which deities were included. The Dodekatheon of Herodorus of Heraclea included Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Hermes, Athena, Apollo, Alpheus, Cronus, Rhea and the Charites. The historian Herodotus states that Heracles was included as one of the Twelve by some. At Kos, Heracles and Dionysus are added to the Twelve, and Ares and Hephaestus are not. For Pindar, the Bibliotheca, and Herodorus, Heracles is not one of the Twelve Gods, but the one who established their cult. Lucian (2nd century AD) includes Heracles and Asclepius as members of the Twelve, without explaining which two had to give way for them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_Olympians &lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The pantheon (not necessarily the Dodecatheon) could also vary geographically, depending on the regional landscape and included gods such as rivers, who were worshipped greatly due to their importance to the survival and well-being of people living in the nearby regions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;P.S.

He makes grand prophecies of what will happen in the future - he is, after all, a prophet. All of this happens while he resides in the woods, in a house with 70 windows and doors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;After he regains his sanity, his sister, Ganieda, and his friends Maeldin and Taliesin decide to turn their backs on the outside and world and live with him in his house in the woods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The chieftains departed. The three remained, and with them a fourth--Ganieda, the prophet's sister, who had finally taken to their way of life also. She had been leading a retired life since the death of the king. She who till now had been the queen of a large nation under the appointed law, now found nothing pleasanter than living in the woods with her brother. She, too, was from time to time exalted in spirit to sing often of the future of the kingdom. So, one day when she stood in her brother's hall and gazed at the house and at its windows glittering in the sun, she uttered these dark sayings out of a dark heart:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;I see the city of Oxford filled with helmeted men, and holy men and holy bishops bound on the decision of the Council.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; She did not end with this, and her friends listened in amazement.  So also did her brother, who after a while went up to her and congratulated her in kindly words, saying, &quot;Sister, is it you the spirit has willed to foretell the future? He has curbed my tongue and closed my book. Then this task is given to you. Be glad of it, and under my authority declare everything faithfully.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Throughout the whole story, Merlin seems to have attributed many things in the world that have helped him to God.

Both because it's excellent and well-explained, and because it's the one sitting on my desk.  [Full text here.](http://people.uncw.edu/deagona/myth/Descent%20Of%20Inanna.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we could take Inanna (Ishtar) at her word.  Her overt reason is given:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inanna answered:  &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Because . . . of my older sister, Ereshkigal,  &#xD;&#xA;Her husband, Gugulanna, the Bull of Heaven, has died.  &#xD;&#xA;I have come to witness the funeral rites.  &#xD;&#xA;Let the beer of his funeral rites be poured into the cup.  &#xD;&#xA;Let it be done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That, however, is just the excuse she gives at the gate.  It doesn't seem likely this is her real reason for the trip.  More likely the real reason is shown here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which gives us the hint that she has heard the Great Below, the underworld, in some way.  Wolkstein's explanations, however, give us more to go on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inanna is the Queen of Heaven and Earth, but she does not know the underworld.  Until her ear opens to the Great Below, her understanding is necessarily limited.  In Sumerian, the word for ear and wisdom is the same ... In order to fully appreciate or &quot;know&quot;  what is said or meant, a great understanding is needed - an understanding of all things.  It is the Great Below, and knowledge of death and rebirth, life and stasis, that will make Inanna an &quot;Honored Counselor&quot; and a guide to the land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So Inanna, already powerful and knowledgeable of Heaven and Earth, needs to acquire knowledge of death and the underworld to be complete in her wisdom.  This is further supported later, from the statement of Enlil, when hearing that Inanna has not returned from the underworld:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;My daughter craved the Great Above.  &#xD;&#xA;Inanna craved the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;She who receives the *me* of the underworld does not return.  &#xD;&#xA;She who goes to the Dark City stays there.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here Enlil (and later, Nanna, in an identical statement) states that Inanna has gone seeking the *me* of the underworld.  [*me* is a tricky word](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/726/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-me-in-the-descent-of-inanna) that most translators refuse to translate, and too much can be said about it to address completely here.  Suffice to say, the *me* represent knowledge and wisdom.  So, the gods know that she has gone seeking that knowledge that can only be gained in the underworld.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To go just one more step, a *very popular* interpretation of the text is through a Jungian lens.  Just to hit the main points very briefly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of gaining wisdom of the underworld, to complement the wisdom of the heavens and of the earth, speaks of Inanna becoming complete, but this interpretation views it, instead of her completing her body of knowledge, she is completing herself, developing into a *whole* person (goddess).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this light, we see Inanna and her sister Ereshkigal as part of the same whole person.  In order to become complete, Inanna must become vulnerable, and face the dark side of herself (Ereshkigal), die and be reborn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Inanna abandons her temples on the way to the underworld, and has to leave her crown, robe and other vestments (also *me*, like I said, complicated) at the gates of the underworld.  She arrives naked, powerless and vulnerable.  The death and rebirth are fairly clear to be read, but of particular interest is that after Inanna's death, and preparing for rebirth, Ereshkigal is in pain &quot;With the cries of a woman about to give birth.&quot;  Which does rather speak to the interpretation of being reborn from her darker half." />

Sort of.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Etymology and related names&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science*, by Jeff Meldrum](http://books.google.com/books?id=ggeQHFa5E7AC&amp;lpg=PA50&amp;dq=salish+sasquatch&amp;pg=PA50&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=salish%20sasquatch&amp;f=false), says (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The various tribes across North America have attached their own names to the entity. These names number more than sixty, but most generally make reference to a &quot;Wildman of the woods.&quot; In the 1920s, Canadian journalist J.W. Burns coined the term *Sasquatch* as a common denominator for the myriad of native names. ***Sasquatch* derives directly from the word &quot;*sésquac*.&quot;** The original word, in the dialect of the Stó:lò dialect of the Halkomelem language, is used by the Coast Sasqu Indians of the Frase Valley and parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This](http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/trivia10.html) translates &quot;sésquac&quot; as &quot;wild man.&quot; [This](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=584) has a passage curiously similar to the one in Meldrum's book:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The term &quot;sasquatch&quot; is an anglicized derivative of the word &quot;Sésquac&quot;, meaning &quot;wild man&quot;. The original word, in the Stó:lõ dialect of the Halkomelem language, is used by the Coast Salish Indians of the Fraser Valley and parts of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Indian tribes across North America have a total of more than sixty different terms for the sasquatch.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Strangely enough, Meldrum is not listed in the [&quot;Useful Links&quot;](http://www.bfro.net/gdb/show_FAQ.asp?id=588) section, though that should not be confused with sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A fairly detailed list of name related to the creature is given by [Ontario Sasquatch](http://www.ontariosasquatch.com/#/canadian-names-pg-1/4522683510). Most related words are simply translated as &quot;Sasquatch&quot; (or &quot;male Sasquatch&quot; or &quot;female Sasquatch&quot;), though the word &quot;Suhsq’uhtch&quot;, used by the Coast Salish people, is translated as &quot;men, covered with dark fur, more than eight feet tall, who leave footprints about twenty inches long.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The Cowicham people gave the creatures the name &quot;Thumquas.&quot;](http://www.joejack.com/sasquatch.html). Interestingly enough, the Cowicham people do speak [Halkomelem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halkomelem), though Wikipedia describes them as speaking a branch distinct from that of the Stó:lò.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;#Mythology&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the most tantalizing sources I could find about the mythology surrounding the name was from the article [&quot;Retired principal puts out second pre-teen novel&quot;, by Clyde Woolman (*Comox Valley Record*)](http://www.comoxvalleyrecord.com/entertainment/224265911.html) (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It at least seems reasonably clear that the origin of the English word came from an Agassiz teacher in the 1920s **who heard the term sasq'ets from the Sts'ailes (Chehalis) people) who live in the area, which described a sollicum, a being of the natural and supernatural world.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The word &quot;sollicum&quot; does not seem to appear anywhere else related the Chehalis mythology - at least, nowhere that I could find.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[A page on SasquatchSighting.ca](http://sasquatchsighting.ca/the-legend-of-saskakaua-creek) claims (emphasis mine),&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The legends of Sasquatch have been part of the Chehalis tribe for centuries. In fact, their oral history says that sasquatch are their mortal enemies.** And in their St:olo dialect the word Saskakaua roughly means “Place of the Wild Men”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*The Sunday Journal and Star*](http://www.bfro.net/GDB/ReportImages/article_bc_1934_NE_large.gif) says much the same thing. In the lower left-hand corner,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The existence of a troglodytic race inhabiting the mountains of British Columbia in many of the vast caves  is a tribal legend among the Chehalis Indians and those of the Skwah Reservation, near Chilliwack, in the Harrison Lake district, about a hundred miles east of Vancouver. Among the Indians the race has been known for centuries by the name &quot;Sasquatch,&quot; or hairy men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The article later says that legends date back &quot;at least three generations&quot; (this was written in 1934).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[This](http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/sasq-ets.htm) also says&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The creature has a spiritual quality for the Chehalis--the spiritual and physical are closely connected in First Nations beliefs.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It also says that First Nations people all over have legends based around the creature, and that rock paintings appear to have been made of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I was not able to find anything about &quot;Thumquas,&quot; unfortunately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One a side note, [the Quinalt people have a legend about a being known as &quot;Glue-Keek&quot;](http://www.bigfootencounters.com/articles/quinalt.htm). A Quinalt woman, Harvest Moon, tells the story (also given [here](http://www.sasquatchchronicles.com/bigfoot-believers/):&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Harvest Moon is familiar with several native legends about Bigfoot. The Quinault woman works as a storyteller at the Lake Quinault Lodge and other resorts along the coast during the summer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; She tells the story of the Glue-Keek monster she learned from a Lummi elder and its ties to the creation of mosquitos. The monster frightens tribal members and prevents them from hunting and gathering food.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; His legs were as big as tree trunks, she said while swaying her hips and making arm and hand gestures during a recent storytelling presentation at the Lake Quinault Lodge. His skin was as tough as leather and his eyes had a hypnotic glow to them. The monster started chasing the women through the berry patch. He took his huge, big feet, knocking over every basket of berries, wasting them on the ground.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; According to the legend, warriors from various tribes gathered and vowed to kill the monster. They dug a hole, tricked Glue-Keek into falling into it and burned him. As Glue-Keek perished, he swore he would return to drink the villagers blood. As his ashes ascended into the air, they transformed into mosquitos." />

At length also, as thickets of tyrants were growing up and bursting forth soon into an immense forest, the island retained the Roman name, but not the morals and law; nay rather, casting forth a shoot of its own planting, **it sends out Maximus[20] to the two Gauls**, accompanied by a great crowd of followers, with an emperor's ensigns in addition, which he never worthily bore nor legitimately, but as one elected after the manner of a tyrant and amid a turbulent soldiery. This man, through cunning art rather than by valour, first attaches to his guilty rule certain neighbouring countries or provinces against the Roman power, by nets of perjury and falsehood. He then extends **one wing to Spain, the other to Italy,** fixing the throne of his iniquitous empire at Trier, and raged with such madness against his lords that he drove two legitimate emperors, the one from Rome, the other from a most pious life. Though fortified by hazardous deeds of so dangerous a character, it was not long ere **he lost his accursed head at Aquileia:** he who had in a way cut off the crowned heads of the empire of the whole world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Picts and Scots.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 14. After this, **Britain is robbed of all her armed soldiery, of her military supplies, of her rulers, cruel though they were, and of her vigorous youth who followed the footsteps of the above-mentioned tyrant and never returned.** Completely ignorant of the practice of war, she is, for the first time, open to be trampled upon by two foreign tribes of extreme cruelty, the Scots from the north-west, the Picts from the north; and for many years continues stunned and groaning.[21]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [*De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae*, St. Gildas, 13-14](http://www.vortigernstudies.org.uk/arthist/vortigernquotesgil.htm)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This sounds like the same story as *The Dream of Macsen Wledig* (emphasis mine):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And immediately the emperor set forth with his army. And these men were his guides. **Towards the Island of Britain they went over the sea and the deep. And he conquered the Island from Beli the son of Manogan,** and his sons, and drove them to the sea, and went forward even unto Arvon. And the emperor knew the land when he saw it. And when he beheld the castle of Aber Sain, &quot;Look yonder,&quot; said he, &quot;there is the castle wherein I saw the damsel whom I best love.&quot; And he went forward into the castle and into the hall, and there he saw Kynan the son of Eudav, and Adeon the son of Eudav, playing at chess. And he saw Eudav the son of Caradawc, sitting on a chair of ivory carving chessmen. And the maiden whom he had beheld in his sleep, he saw sitting on a chair of gold. &quot;Empress of Rome,&quot; said he, &quot;all hail!&quot; And the emperor threw his arms about her neck; and that night she became his bride.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt;...  &#xD;&#xA;&gt;Seven years did the emperor tarry in this Island. Now, at that time, the men of Rome had a custom, that whatsoever emperor should remain in other lands more than seven years, should remain to his own overthrow, and should never return to Rome again.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt;So they made a new emperor. And this one wrote a letter of threat to Maxen. There was nought in the letter but only this. &quot;If thou comest, and if thou ever comest to Rome.&quot; And even unto Caerlleon came this letter to Maxen, and these tidings. Then sent he a letter to the man who styled himself emperor in Rome. There was nought in that letter also but only this. &quot;If I come to Rome, and if I come.&quot;   &#xD;&#xA;&gt;**And thereupon Maxen set forth towards Rome with his army, and vanquished France and Burgundy, and every land on the way, and sat down before the city of Rome.**   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Dream of Macscen Wledig](http://www.ancienttexts.org/library/celtic/ctexts/macsen.html)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we know the historical figure is the same as the story's figure, we can talk a little about the history. Magnus Maximus was the emperor of the [**Western** Roman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Roman_Empire) from 383-388 AD. The empire fell approximately 90-120 years later. For comparison, calling this story part of Roman Mythology would be a little bit like regarding the [Spanish-American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish%E2%80%93American_War) as part of *&quot;American Mythology&quot;*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Most of Roman folklore and mythology comes from stories like [Ovid's Metamorphoses - 8 AD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses), [Virgil's Aeneid - ~25 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid), and [Livy's Ab Urbe Condita Libri - ~25 BC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ab_Urbe_Condita_Libri_(Livy)). Note that this is hardly a comprehensive list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, Magnus Maximus was too close to the fall of the Roman empire to be reasonably included in it's mythos; he was emperor after the Empire split in two. This is why it is a relevant myth for the [5th century newly rising Anglo-Saxons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_settlement_of_Britain), but not for the Romans themselves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sub&gt;Note: I have decided that Wikipedia is a sufficient source for this part of answer as the facts contained herein are basic, widely accepted historic facts of the era.&lt;/sub&gt;" />

The four Yugas known as Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali together make up one Mahayuga, and a thousand Mahayugas make up one Kalpa or day of Brahma.  But in addition to being divided into 1000 Mahayugas, a Kalpa is also divided into fourteen Manvantaras, each of which is made up of about 71 Mahayugas.  We're currently living in the seventh Manvantara of the present Kalpa, known as the Vaivasvata Manavantara, and we're living in the 28th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we have some background, in [this chapter][1] of the Matsya Purana (an important Hindu scripture), various incarnations of Vishnu in the present Vaivasvata Manvantara are described.  But Kalki is only mentioned once, and that is in the current Kali Yuga.  [This excerpt][2] from the Skanda Purana says the same thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And we can find explicit references to how Kali Yugas have ended in the past.  In particular, [this chapter][3] of the famous Hindu epic the Mahabharata describes how Vishnu's incarnation Parashurama brought about the end of the 19th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara by killing the kings of the world:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Even the great ascetic Rama, the hero worshipped by all heroes, that son of Jamadagni, of great fame, will die, without being contented (with the period of his life). **Rooting out all evils from the earth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in.** Having obtained unrivalled prosperity, no fault could be seen in him. His father having been slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any boast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With his bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already within the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen thousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a thousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging. Heroic warriors, with their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by the wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father. And Rama, on that occasion, slew ten thousand Kshatriyas with his axe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, as far as I know there was only one other occasion where Vishnu took a Kalki incarnation.  The Kalki incarnation was named Pramati, and he seems to have lived in the Swayambhuva Manvantara, the first Manvantara of the present Kalpa.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the way, if you're interested in those lists of Vaivasvata Manvantara incarnations found in the Matsya and Skanda Puranas, I've posted a few questions about them on Hinduism.SE, [here][4], [here][5], and [here][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.com/books?id=nckrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%2224th%20treta%22&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.indianscriptures.com/Content/Articles/PDFs/27478/62f_chapter_19_2.pdf#toolbar=0&amp;pagemode=none&amp;view=FitBH&amp;page=1%22&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://Even%20the%20great%20ascetic%20Rama,%20the%20hero%20worshipped%20by%20all%20heroes,%20that%20son%20of%20Jamadagni,%20of%20great%20fame,%20will%20die,%20without%20being&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7192/36&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7194/36&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7221/36" />

I've seen many modern books wrongly claiming that hope did escape the box and, despite all evil that was spread throughout the land, people still hoped that better days would soon come. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hesiod is the one that refers to the box (it was not a box actually, but more like a jar) and claims that Pandora (actually referring to women) is the root of all evil, because she would hurt the man with her beauty and lies.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;For from her is the descent of female women       &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;a great pain for mortals, living with men, &lt;br/&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;companions not of destructive Poverty but of Plenty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Theogony][2]&lt;sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When Pandora opened the box, all evil escaped it, but Pandora (under Zeus' will) held hope inside the jar by closing the lid. Isiodus doesn't say why hope stayed into the jar, but one (judging from Isiodus' view on women) can imply that  he meant by that, that the men would have no hope against women, for without her, they would die alone, but with her, they'd have to withstand their cunning nature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Judging by this, which is how Hesiod closes [Theogony][3]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Thus it is not possible to escape the mind of Zeus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Theogony][4]&lt;sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; an angry Zeus decides to give humanity a punishing gift to compensate for the boon they had been given.

The &quot;heresy&quot; and the subsequent worship of God began in Thrace [*a region in Northern Greece*] where, according to Homer, Ares lived. From there, the cult spread to Viotia [*Another region of Greece*] and then throughout Greece completely, leading to the establishment of Ares as one of the twelve gods of Olympus. The properties of Ares were associated with its roots since, for the ancient Greeks, **Thrace was a place of hard people and customs.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Ekivolos.gr][7]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be noted, that ancient Greeks had two war gods in order to demonstrate that a subtle technique of conducting war is a lot more efficient than brute force.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Σε αντίθεση με την Αθηνά που επινοούσε μεθοδικούς τρόπους για να κηρύττει και να διεξάγει  πόλεμο, ο Άρης αγαπούσε τις αιματοχυσίες και τις χαοτικές μάχες. Στον Τρωικό πόλεμο, ο Άρης τραυματίστηκε σοβαρά από την Αθηνά καθώς βοηθούσε τους Τρώες, αποδεικνύοντας έτσι ότι η τεχνική ήταν ικανή να υπερνικήσει την ωμή βία.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unlike Athena who invented methodical ways to preach and to conduct war, Ares loved bloodshed and chaotic battles. The Trojan war, Ares was seriously injured by Athena as help the Trojans, **thus proving that the technique was able to overcome brute force.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Ekivolos.gr][8]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenism_%28religion%29&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm" />

The general consensus about Loki is that pinning him down to one thing is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. The 9th-century poem [Haustlong][1] calls him the &quot;rouser of tales&quot; and I think that's as close as we're going to get to a defintion of Loki. &#xD;&#xA;It is ironic that Logi is confused with Loki, as they are opponents in the contests that Utgard-loki sets up.

Ο αιμοδιψής Άρης ήταν πολεμικός θεός, ο οποίος εκπροσωπούσε τη μανία και το παράλογο του πολέμου.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Athena, who initially was an armed Goddess of War and then became a patron goddess of Athens and a symbol of wisdom, (...) &#xD;&#xA;The bloodthirsty Ares was a war god, who represented the fury and the absurdity of war.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Ekivolos.gr][1]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; While both gods are representantives of war, [Ares][2] actually represented the violence of war, while [Athena][3] was believed to have taught the Greek warriors the the art of war.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Η μαχητική φύση της Αθηνάς εξαιτίας της  οποίας  λατρευόταν ως Άρια, διαφοροποιούνταν από τον χαρακτήρα του Άρη, το θεό του πολέμου. Ο Άρης αντιπροσώπευε αναρχικές διαμάχες, την βία του πολέμου, ενώ η Αθηνά πιστευόταν ότι είχε διδάξει στην ανθρωπότητα τις τεχνικές και τους κανόνες του πολέμου. Ως αποτέλεσμα, τα δυο αδέλφια συχνά περιγράφονταν από αρχαίους συγγραφείς σε μια κατάσταση διαμάχης και αυτό ήταν ιδιαίτερα αληθινό κατά την διάρκεια του Τρωικού πολέμου.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The combative nature of Athena because of which she was worshipped, **differentiated from the nature of Ares**, the god of war. **Ares represented anarchist struggles, the violence of war**, **while Athena was believed to have taught mankind the techniques and the rules of war**. As a result, the two brothers often were described by ancient writers in a conflict situation and that was especially true during the Trojan war.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Ekivolos.gr][4]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Ares][5] never became a patron god and was not worshipped as much as the other gods initially, although he was established as a god of the [Dodekatheon][6] later on, tied to people who had tough and violent customs: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Όπως ήταν φυσικό, καμιά πόλη δεν τον έκανε πολιούχο της ενώ δεν ήταν ιδιαίτερα αγαπητός και στον κύκλο των υπολοίπων θεών. Για τους αρχαίους Έλληνες ο Άρης ήταν η κυρίαρχη φιγούρα πίσω από την βία, τις μάχες και τις άλλες διαμάχες μεταξύ των ανδρών.  Η «αίρεση» και η συνακόλουθη λατρεία  του θεού μάλλον άρχισε στην Θράκη όπου σύμφωνα με τον Όμηρο ζούσε ο Άρης. Από εκεί η λατρεία  του εξαπλώθηκε στην Βοιωτία και μετά σε ολόκληρη την Ελλάδα ολοκληρωτικά, οδηγώντας στην καθιέρωση του Άρη ως ενός  από τους δώδεκα θεούς του Ολύμπου. Οι ιδιότητες του Άρη συνδέονται με τις ρίζες του αφού, για τους αρχαίους Έλληνες, η Θράκη ήταν ένα μέρος σκληρών ανθρώπων και εθίμων.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;Naturally, no city made him a patron god and he was not as popular as the other gods. For the ancient Greeks Ares was the dominant figure behind violence, battles and other conflicts among men. The &quot;heresy&quot; and the subsequent worship of God began in Thrace [*a region in Northern Greece*] where, according to Homer, Ares lived. From there, the cult spread to Viotia [*Another region of Greece*] and then throughout Greece completely, leading to the establishment of Ares as one of the twelve gods of Olympus. The properties of Ares were associated with its roots since, for the ancient Greeks, **Thrace was a place of hard people and customs.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Ekivolos.gr][7]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be noted, that ancient Greeks had two war gods in order to demonstrate that a subtle technique of conducting war is a lot more efficient than brute force.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Σε αντίθεση με την Αθηνά που επινοούσε μεθοδικούς τρόπους για να κηρύττει και να διεξάγει  πόλεμο, ο Άρης αγαπούσε τις αιματοχυσίες και τις χαοτικές μάχες. Στον Τρωικό πόλεμο, ο Άρης τραυματίστηκε σοβαρά από την Αθηνά καθώς βοηθούσε τους Τρώες, αποδεικνύοντας έτσι ότι η τεχνική ήταν ικανή να υπερνικήσει την ωμή βία.&#xD;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unlike Athena who invented methodical ways to preach and to conduct war, Ares loved bloodshed and chaotic battles. In the Trojan war, Ares was seriously injured by Athena as he was helping the Trojans, **thus proving that technique was able to overcome brute force.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt;[Ekivolos.gr][8]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenism_%28religion%29&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.ekivolos.gr/H%20thrhskeia%20twn%20arxaiwn%20ellhnwn.htm" />

The devil said to the Jew : &quot;Let him deny the son of Mary and those things which are offensive to me, and let him set down in writing that he denieth absolutely, and whatsoever he may desire he shall obtain from me, so long as he denieth.&quot;  Then Satan entered into the steward and he replied : &quot;I deny Christ and His mother.&quot;  And making a written statement and putting wax on it, he sealed it with his own ring and the two went away rejoicing greatly at his perdition." />

Early published versions were generally based on less complete information, and had to make assumptions that turned out incorrect, especially with regards to Dumuzi's (Tammuz) role in the story (See: or Kramer's explanation of the decipherment in [the this print version](http://www.amazon.com/Inanna-Queen-Heaven-Earth-Stories/dp/0060908548), and also [&quot;Tammuz and the Bible&quot;](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3265029)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will be using [Wolkstein and Kramer's translation](http://www.amazon.com/Inanna-Queen-Heaven-Earth-Stories/dp/0060908548) of the text, published in 1983.  Both because it's excellent and well-explained, and because it's the one sitting on my desk.  [Full text here.](http://people.uncw.edu/deagona/myth/Descent%20Of%20Inanna.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we could take Inanna (Ishtar) at her word.  Her overt reason is given:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inanna answered:  &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Because . . . of my older sister, Ereshkigal,  &#xD;&#xA;Her husband, Gugulanna, the Bull of Heaven, has died.  &#xD;&#xA;I have come to witness the funeral rites.  &#xD;&#xA;Let the beer of his funeral rites be poured into the cup.  &#xD;&#xA;Let it be done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That, however, is just the excuse she gives at the gate.  It doesn't seem likely this is her real reason for the trip.  More likely the real reason is shown here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which gives us the hint that she has heard the Great Below, the underworld, in some way.  Wolkstein's explanations, however, give us more to go on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inanna is the Queen of Heaven and Earth, but she does not know the underworld.  Until her ear opens to the Great Below, her understanding is necessarily limited.  In Sumerian, the word for ear and wisdom is the same ... In order to fully appreciate or &quot;know&quot;  what is said or meant, a great understanding is needed - an understanding of all things.  It is the Great Below, and knowledge of death and rebirth, life and stasis, that will make Inanna an &quot;Honored Counselor&quot; and a guide to the land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So Inanna, already powerful and knowledgeable of Heaven and Earth, needs to acquire knowledge of death and the underworld to be complete in her wisdom.  This is further supported later, from the statement of Enlil, when hearing that Inanna has not returned from the underworld:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;My daughter craved the Great Above.  &#xD;&#xA;Inanna craved the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;She who receives the *me* of the underworld does not return.  &#xD;&#xA;She who goes to the Dark City stays there.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here Enlil (and later, Nanna, in an identical statement) states that Inanna has gone seeking the *me* of the underworld.  [*me* is a tricky word](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/726/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-me-in-the-descent-of-inanna) that most translators refuse to translate, and too much can be said about it to address completely here.  Suffice to say, the *me* represent knowledge and wisdom.  So, the gods know that she has gone seeking that knowledge that can only be gained in the underworld.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To go just one more step, a *very popular* interpretation of the text is through a Jungian lens.  Just to hit the main points very briefly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of gaining wisdom of the underworld, to complement the wisdom of the heavens and of the earth, speaks of Inanna becoming complete, but this interpretation views it, instead of her completing her body of knowledge, she is completing herself, developing into a *whole* person (goddess).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this light, we see Inanna and her sister Ereshkigal as part of the same whole person.  In order to become complete, Inanna must become vulnerable, and face the dark side of herself (Ereshkigal), die and be reborn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Inanna abandons her temples on the way to the underworld, and has to leave her crown, robe and other vestments (also *me*, like I said, complicated) at the gates of the underworld.  She arrives naked, powerless and vulnerable.  The death and rebirth are fairly clear to be read, but of particular interest is that after Inanna's death, and preparing for rebirth, Ereshkigal is in pain &quot;With the cries of a woman about to give birth.&quot;  Which does rather speak to the interpretation of being reborn from her darker half." />

One possible explanation is as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Norse shamanic tradition, Odin's ravens represent the powers of necromancy, clairvoyance and telepathy, and they were guides for the dead. This poem expresses the shaman's fear of his loss of magical powers. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt; **The Well of Remembrance by Ralph Metzner, Shambala, Boston, 1994**&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, it is implied the name of one of the ravens is mistranslated:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  **it’s often claimed that Munin’s name means “Memory,” but for this to be so, it would have to be derived from minni**, “memory,” **rather than munr, “desire.”** The latter, however, is by far the more parsimonious derivation; if the former were the case, we should expect Munin’s Old Norse name to have been something like “Minninn” rather than “Muninn.” Moreover, **the above verse from the Grímnismál makes much more sense if Munin’s name means “Desire” rather than “Memory”** it’s often claimed that Munin’s name means “Memory,” but for this to be so, it would have to be derived from minni, “memory,” rather than munr, “desire.” The latter, however, is by far the more parsimonious derivation; **if the former were the case, we should expect Munin’s Old Norse name to have been something like “Minninn” rather than “Muninn.”** Moreover, the above verse from the Grímnismál makes much more sense if Munin’s name means “Desire” rather than “Memory”.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[Norse Mythology for Smart People][1]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another possible explanation is the following, which is similar to first one:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Anthony Winterbourne** connects Huginn and Muninn to the Norse concepts **of the fylgja—a concept with three characteristics; shape-shifting abilities, good fortune, and the guardian spirit—and the hamingja—the ghostly double of a person that may appear in the form of an animal.** Winterbourne states that “**The shaman’s journey through the different parts of the cosmos is symbolized by the hamingja concept of the shape-shifting soul, and gains another symbolic dimension for the Norse soul in the account of Oðin’s ravens, Huginn and Muninn.”** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&lt;sub&gt; [My Travels with Huggin and Munnin][2]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, [Rudolf Simek][3] has an entirely different point to make, saying that the names of the ravens were only used in later times:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Rudolf Simek is critical of the approach**, stating that **&quot;attempts have been made to interpret Odin's ravens as a personification of the god's intellectual powers, but this can only be assumed from the names Huginn and Muninn themselves which were unlikely to have been invented much before the 9th or 10th centuries&quot;** yet that the two ravens, as Odin's companions, appear to derive from much earlier times. **Instead, Simek connects Huginn and Muninn with wider raven symbolism in the Germanic world, including the Raven Banner (described in English chronicles and Scandinavian sagas), a banner which was woven in a method that allowed it, when fluttering in the wind, to appear as if the raven depicted upon it was beating its wings.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;[Wikipedia][4]&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/others/hugin-and-munin/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://ljmoore.wordpress.com/2013/03/16/my-travels-with-huginn-and-muninn/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Simek&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huginn_and_Muninn#Theories" />

No one accepts these ideas now, as Rudolf Simek and John Lindow make clear in the dictionaries of Norse myth. The general consensus about Loki is that pinning him down to one thing is like nailing Jell-O to the wall. The 9th-century poem [Haustlong][1] calls him the &quot;rouser of tales&quot; and I think that's as close as we're going to get to a defintion of Loki. &#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is ironic that Logi is confused with Loki, as they are opponents in the contests that Utgard-loki sets up.

Then she said&#xD;&#xA;&gt; unto him, &quot;I declare to thee, that it is thy destiny not to be suited&#xD;&#xA;&gt; with a wife until thou obtain Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Penkawr.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is easy to miss, because the characters act like it's no big deal: Kilhwch is told that it &quot;will be easy for thee&quot; to marry Olwen. However, keep in mind the following three things:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. It wasn't easy: the characters have to achieve several supposedly impossible magical tasks in order for Kilhwch to be able to marry Olwen.&#xD;&#xA;2. These characters are accustomed to magic (the relationship between the real world and the magical world is a common theme in the Mabinogion).&#xD;&#xA;3. A central theme in the story is the control of reproductive power. This story features a &quot;jealous stepmother&quot; motif; to quote from [Will Parker's Mabinogion.info][1] (which quotes Stephen Knight's Culhwch analysis):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;   &gt; The threat represented in the essential plot of the story us the failure of the family to reproduce itself. The stepmother’s curse means Culhwch will either go childless or be killed by the giant … the central fear [is] of a sterile generation and of reproductive power lying in enemy hands, whether giants or stepmothers. (Arthurian Literature and Society Macmillan Press, 1963 pp 16-18)&#xD;&#xA;  &#xD;&#xA;    The story is, in a way, a precursor to stories like Cinderella: the stepmother wants to control the father, so she controls the father's children with his first wife.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I don't know why the crone first concealed Kilhwch (Culhwch) from the stepmother, and then revealed Kilhwch to her. That could be explained as an inconsistency in the text, or as the stepmother persuading the crone with her emotion by her &quot;lament on account of that.&quot; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(The stepmother said &quot;woe is me, that I should have come to one who is childless!&quot; when she heard King Kilydd had no children. This is another example of the importance of fertility: she wants to be able to have children and control the King.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.mabinogion.info/culhwch.htm" />

I got the impression they were playing checkers, but I may have just seen it that way because I was a child and didn't know what they were really playing and never played othello.

I think there was another illustration for another story, depicting a flower like a lotus in the ocean (this is not rare imagery so I have doubts about remembering this right) for the first story in the book which was a creation myth in which the world was covered in ocean, and a flower appeared, and a woman came out of it, or there was no flower.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;What is this story?

I want to ask you about Hermes, since Cratylus says I am not Hermogenes (son of Hermes). Let us investigate the name of Hermes, to find out whether there is anything in what he says.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Socrates**  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Well then, this name “Hermes” seems to me to have to do with speech; he is an interpreter (ἡρμηνεύς) and a messenger, is wily and deceptive in speech, and is oratorical. All this activity is concerned with the power of speech. Now, as I said before, εἴρειν denotes the use of speech; moreover, Homer often uses the word ἐμήσατο, which means “contrive.” From these two words, then, the lawgiver imposes upon us the name of this god who contrived speech and the use of speech—εἴρειν means “speak” and tells us: “Ye human beings, he who contrived speech (εἴρειν ἐμήσατο) ought to be called Eiremes by you.” We, however, have beautified the name, as we imagine, and call him Hermes. Iris also seems to have got her name from εἴρειν, because she is a messenger.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source [Plato, Cratylus, p.408](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg005.perseus-eng1:408)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hermes was the messenger of the gods, and naturally writing would be essential to him. He isn't however credited with inventing writing, at least not until Roman times: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [143] CXLIII. PHORONEUS&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inachus, son of Oceanus, begat Phoroneus by his sister Argia, and he is said to have been the first of mortals to rule. Men for many centuries before lived without town or laws, speaking one tongue under the rule of Jove. But after Mercury had explained the languages of men (when he is called ermeneutes, “interpreter,” for Mercury in Greek is called Hermes; he too, divided the nations), then discord arose among mortals, which was not pleasing to Jove. And so he gave over the first rule to Phoroneus, because hew as first to make offerings to Juno.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [277] CCLXXVII. FIRST INVENTORS&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Parcae, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos invented seven Greek letters - A B H T I Y.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Others say that Mercury invented them from the flight of cranes, which, when they fly, form letters.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Palamedes, too, son of Nauplius, invented eleven letters; Simonides, too, invented four letters – Ó E Z PH; Epicharmus of Sicily, two - P and PS.    &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Greek letters Mercury is said to have brought to Egypt, and from Egypt Cadmus took them to Greece. Cadmus in exile from Arcadia, took them to Italy, and his mother Carmenta changed them to Latin to the number of 15.   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Apollo on the lyre added the rest.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Myths of Hyginus, translated and edited by Mary Grant](http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html)&lt;/sub&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hyginus belief that Hermes brought the Greek letters from Egypt is interesting because Hermes would some times be identified with [Thoth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth), who the Egyptians did credit with inventing writing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, the Greeks probably didn't think of writing as a product of divine inspiration; in fact, they were aware their alphabet derived from the Phoenician one: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; These Phoenicians who came with [Cadmus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus) and of whom the Gephyraeans were a part brought with them to Hellas, among many other kinds of learning, the alphabet, which had been unknown before this, I think, to the Greeks.

It is a [very old game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Go): although the first occurrence of this game in chinese literature date from the 4th century BC, legends date its origins in the 2nd millenium BC. Consequently, due to its age, it is a game that one encounter frequently in eastern Asia legends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Links between the game and astrology, in popular culture, are legions, due to the inherent look of a game in progress. In fact, in modern japanese, the central point of the board is referred to as the *[tengen](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tengen)* (litt. origin of Heaven) and the other marked intersections as *[hoshi](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Hoshi)* (litt. stars).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chinese historian Ban Gu (32-92 AD) in *Yi Zhi* (Essence of Go) wrote about the game:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The board must be square, for it represents the Earth laws.

It is a [very old game](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Go): although the first occurrence of this game in chinese literature date from the 4th century BC, legends date its origins in the 2nd millenium BC. Consequently, due to its age, it is a game that one encounter frequently in eastern Asia legends.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Links between the game and astrology/astronomy are legions, due to the inherent look of a game in progress. In fact, in modern japanese, the central point of the board is referred to as the *[tengen](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Tengen)* (litt. origin of Heaven) and the other marked intersections as *[hoshi](http://senseis.xmp.net/?Hoshi)* (litt. stars).  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chinese historian Ban Gu (32-92 AD) in *Yi Zhi* (Essence of Go) wrote about the game:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;The board must be square, for it represents the Earth laws. The lines must be straight for they embody the spirit of pure virtue. The pieces are white and black, and so are divided into the Yin and the Yang.

Maybe he will ignore the question, maybe he will say that you are bad at looking for things in the forest, [maybe he will go Rick Riordan and invent something similar to the mist][1] (which was based on something said in the Iliad, where a god prevented a mortal from seeing something), maybe he will will say [&quot;because it's death to look on a god/goddess in their true form&quot;][2], or maybe he will say [&quot;because Artemis kills \[male\] mortals who spy on her&quot;][3]. There are many &quot;logical&quot; explanations storytellers can make. The storyteller may also think you are an atheist ([there were atheists in Greece at the time][4]). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(That paragraph should have answered your question.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's what I think: **it doesn't matter**. As you can tell from the variety of &quot;excuses&quot;, coming up with a consistent explanation for why people don't see magic **is not a priority of religions or storytellers**. People who understand religions or literature (i.e. not the internet) know that *the supernatural is a metaphor*, and is not supposed to make rational or scientific sense. It's only recently that we've seen [authors][5] (and people on the internet) trying to reconcile irrational metaphors with rational science. In my opinion, it's a complete waste of time and won't lead to a better understanding of the story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The well-known religions of the developed world...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Are you referring to Abrahamic religions, or just Christianity and Judaism (not Islam)? Either way, you have an extremely small sample size: most &quot;pagan&quot;/&quot;non-modern&quot; religions that I can think of are based around the idea of gods/spirits interacting with the real world on a regular basis. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ...teach about an all-powerful, transcendental God, existing in a state far beyond our understanding of space and time, who will come at the end of the world but until then doesn't interfere too much or too visibly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;God did &quot;interfere&quot; with the world several times, both in the new testament and the old, and a similar question to this one is *how do Christians explain how God created the world in seven days when the majority of scientific evidence says that's not possible?*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which gets back to my original point: asking for religions (and literature in general) to justify themselves scientifically is neither the point of religion nor the best way to understand religion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will accept my downvotes stoically. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://camphalfblood.wikia.com/wiki/Mist&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semele#Seduction_by_Zeus_and_birth_of_Dionysus&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actaeon&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://atheism.about.com/od/atheismhistory/a/AncientGreeceSkepticism.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://worldbuilding.stackexchange.com/" />

Maybe there is one, and I just missed it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not interested in speculation, but in real sources. Was there any indication in the myths or any written records by philosophers or historians why the supernatural creatures are missing? In that time they still had temples where they had active services for the gods which, according to the myths, often, and visibly, physically visited their temples and human settlements. " />

Each site is really as a different deity, Mary gets an epithet of the site, and is specially celebrated. IMHO this is a continuation of the ancient greek religiosity. The temples turned into churches. (St Helias churches are on top of hills, for example, where the temples of Apollo-Helios were located, the association clear). Each house has a small iconostasis with a candle lit from the resurrection ceremony light once a year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here is the most popular prayer to God as Holy Spirit in current orthodox christianity:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Heavenly King][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Heavenly King , &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Paraclete ,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;the Spirit of truth ,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;who is ubiquitous and &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;permeates everything&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;the treasurer of goods&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;and the giver of life,&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;come and dwell in us&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;......&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the deity is present though only seen in the churches.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Extrapolating from the present religiosity to the ancient religiosity should not be a big step. The ancients had the statues, not icons, three dimensional representations of the gods, in full color, not the immaculate white of the underlying marble, but vivid color. The houses had the house altar. In a similar way with the present, their gods were with them in their everyday life, with the prayers and votive offerings,  the new dresses sewn for the name day, the processions. Their gods were interwoven with their life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One could say that they had captured ( like a three dimensional photo)their gods to keep them in their societies. From this last it is evident that they gave a spiritual immaterial format to their gods in general. Again not different than the way saints and divinity  are  still currently seen.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_church_architecture#Iconostasis&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.paidika.gr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=692&amp;Itemid=83" />

The four of them would pair off to oppose each other.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now it was on the path leading to Xibalba [the underworld] where they played ball. Thus&#xD;&#xA;&gt; the lords of Xibalba, One Death and Seven Death, heard them:&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&gt; “What is happening on the surface of the earth? They are just stomping&#xD;&#xA;&gt; about and shouting. May they be summoned here therefore. They shall&#xD;&#xA;&gt; come to play ball, and we shall defeat them. They have simply failed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; to honor us. They have neither honor nor respect.

In an extent printed storyteller's prompt book of the Southern Song Dynasty, titled *The Tale of How Sanzang of the Great Tang Dynasty Fetched the Scriptures*, Monkey appears among Xuanzang's companions in episodes such as The Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Slaying the White Tiger Spirit, Expelling the Dragon Kui, Overcoming the Deep Sand God and Stealing and Eating the Peach of Immortality. Although the characterization is somewhat coarse and unimaginative, Monkey is from then on a permanent fixture in the framework of the stories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several theories on where does this character come from, the main theories being that he derives from the [indian monkey-god Hanuman](http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp081_monkey_sun_wukong.pdf), or that his roots can be found in the [Fukien cult of Ch'i-t'ien Ta-sheng](https://books.google.de/books?id=bNo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;ots=GCxeBPQWjA&amp;dq=The%20Hsi-yu%20chi%3A%20A%20Study%20of%20Antecedents%20to%20the%20Sixteenth-Century%20Chinese%20Novel&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), some link Sun Wukong with the [monkey worshipped in Lingyin Si](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2719331.pdf), etc.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whichever theory is correct, it seems that the path Sun Wukong followed is not actually from fantasy novel to mythology/folklore but instead from mythology to novel, and then only to mythology/folklore again.&#xD;&#xA;And whichever theory is correct, the fact remains that the post-*Journey to the West* Sun Wukong and whichever monkey-god he originally was are significantly different, as he was completely reshaped by the novel(s).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Concerning the novel to mythology transition, here is what Whalen Lai (1994) says about it in [*Protean Ape to Handsome Saint: the Monkey King*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1178559.pdf):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We scholars may think  of Monkey as nothing  more than a literary creation, but the  common folk of China know better.  To us,  a text  is just  a text,  but to  them *Journey* is more than fable:  it tells of reality.  The  Sage  Equal to  Heaven  is  a living  reality, as real as St. Christopher is to an old-time  Catholic.  As  St.  Christopher still protects travelers, Monkey still  answers prayers.  Monkey  has  his  own temple; he was worshipped  and prayed to  as a god by the  history-making rebels of  the  Boxer  Rebellion.

In an extent printed storyteller's prompt book of the Southern Song Dynasty, titled *The Tale of How Sanzang of the Great Tang Dynasty Fetched the Scriptures*, Monkey appears among Xuanzang's companions in episodes such as The Mountain of Flowers and Fruit, Slaying the White Tiger Spirit, Expelling the Dragon Kui, Overcoming the Deep Sand God and Stealing and Eating the Peach of Immortality. Although the characterization is somewhat coarse and unimaginative, Monkey is from then on a permanent fixture in the framework of the stories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are several theories on where does this character come from, the main theories being that he derives from the [indian monkey-god Hanuman](http://sino-platonic.org/complete/spp081_monkey_sun_wukong.pdf), or that his roots can be found in the [Fukien cult of Ch'i-t'ien Ta-sheng](https://books.google.de/books?id=bNo8AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PP2&amp;ots=GCxeBPQWjA&amp;dq=The%20Hsi-yu%20chi%3A%20A%20Study%20of%20Antecedents%20to%20the%20Sixteenth-Century%20Chinese%20Novel&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false), some link Sun Wukong with the [monkeys worshipped in Lingyin Si](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2719331.pdf), etc.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whichever theory is correct, it seems that the path Sun Wukong followed is not actually from fantasy novel to mythology/folklore but instead from mythology to novel, and then only to mythology/folklore again.&#xD;&#xA;And whichever theory is correct, the fact remains that the post-*Journey to the West* Sun Wukong and whichever monkey-god he originally was are significantly different, as he was completely reshaped by the novel(s).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Concerning the novel to mythology transition, here is what Whalen Lai (1994) says about it in [*Protean Ape to Handsome Saint: the Monkey King*](http://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/1178559.pdf):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We scholars may think  of Monkey as nothing  more than a literary creation, but the  common folk of China know better.  To us,  a text  is just  a text,  but to  them *Journey* is more than fable:  it tells of reality.  The  Sage  Equal to  Heaven  is  a living  reality, as real as St. Christopher is to an old-time  Catholic.  As  St.  Christopher still protects travelers, Monkey still  answers prayers.  Monkey  has  his  own temple; he was worshipped  and prayed to  as a god by the  history-making rebels of  the  Boxer  Rebellion.  This  Great  Sage is still  present to  those  who have eyes to  see  and  ears to  hear.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The novel, however, had the effect of elevating him to a high status, at least relative to popularity.

Tolkien:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; _Fairy,_ as a noun more or less equivalent to _elf,_ is a relatively modern word, hardly used until the Tudor period. The first quotation in the Oxford Dictionary (the only one before A.D. 1450) is significant. It is taken from the poet Gower: _as he were a faerie._ But this Gower did not say. He wrote _as he were of faerie,_ &quot;as if he were come from faerie&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The source for this is his noted essay [&quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;](http://excellence-in-literature.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/fairystoriesbytolkien.pdf), pp 3 (PDF). (I have taken one liberty in transcribing it: the PDF to which I linked appears to have dropped the italics. Tolkien used italics heavily; my memory of first reading &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; includes that customary italicization; so I have attempted to recreate it as best I can. If I got it wrong, that's on me.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, it's bracing to hear a professional imply that the use of the term &quot;fairies&quot; stems mainly from a publisher's error. Tolkien certainly knew his field, and was probably familiar with the occasional accident in transcription carrying large linguistic consequences.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For what it's worth, Tolkien did not hesitate to place Feerie - the land, not the inhabitants - in its proper place in mythology &amp; folklore. From the same essay, on page 4:&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Faerie contains many things besides elves and fays, and besides dwarfs, witches, trolls, giants, or dragons: it holds the seas, the sun, the moon, the sky; and the earth, and all things that are in it: tree and bird, water&#xD;&#xA;and stone, wine and bread, and ourselves, mortal men, when we are enchanted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That rather magnificent bit of wordsmithing outlines the beginning's of Tolkien's theme for the essay. I won't issue spoilers, but this admittedly fairly long piece might be of considerable interest to mythology.SE." />

In Hittite mythology, the sky/storm god [Tarhunt][1] had as his nemesis a snake/dragon god [Illuyanka][2]. Note the similarities here between the story of Thor and the [World Serpent][3]. Both are Indo-European peoples, so this is likely not coincidental.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are [two surviving accounts][4] of this story, both from [CTH 321][5]. In the second&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, Illuyanka wins an initial fight with Tarhunt, and takes his heart and eyes. So now blind, Tarhunt has to rely on trickery. He marries, fathers a son, and then marries him off to the snake's daughter. With that entry to the snake's home, Tarhunt gets his son to retrieve the eyes and heart so that he may renew the battle (at which Tarhunt is victorious and kills the serpent, but at the cost of his own son).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    (21) The serpent defeated the Storm-god and took his heart and eyes. ...&#xD;&#xA;    (22) And he took as his wife the daughter of a poor man, and he sired a&#xD;&#xA;         son. When he grew up, he took as his wife the daughter of the serpent.&#xD;&#xA;    (23) The Storm-god instructed his son: &quot;When you go to the house of your &#xD;&#xA;         wife, then demand from them my heart and eyes!&quot;&#xD;&#xA;    ...&#xD;&#xA;    (25) When he was again sound in body as of old, then he went once more to&#xD;&#xA;         the sea for battle.

Historically, this has been particularly prevalent in [Fukien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujian), but stories similar to Sun Wu Kong's backstory can be found in several regions. **This predates the *c.* 1592 [*Journey to the West*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Journey_to_the_West)**, but the popularity of that novel furnished the traditional monkey deity with a standardised (sort of) backstory and the name Sun Wu Kong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Roots of the modern monkey deity worship certainly predates the late 16th century fictional work, however. From about the late Yuan dynasty, elements of traditional folklore were incorporated into fictional works. A play by the Mongolian playwrite Yang Jing-xian, confusingly also titled *Journey to the West*, contains an autobiographic line by a certain *&quot;Itinerant Monk Sun&quot;* (recycled into the much later novel as a common title for Sun Wu Kong):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 《元·楊景賢·西遊記·第三本》小聖弟兄、姊妹五人，大姊驪山老母，二妹巫枝祗聖母，大兄齊天大聖，小聖通天大聖，三弟耍耍三郎&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I have five brothers and sisters. Big sister is the *Old Lady of [Mt Li](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Li)*; little sister is the *Wu Zhiqi Sage*; big brother is the *Heaven Rivaling Great Sage*; **I am the *Heaven Reaching Great Sage***; and little brother is Shua Shua.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note that here, Xuanzhong's monkey companion has a name (Heaven Reaching Great Sage) that's different form its usual modern version (Heaven Rivaling Great Sage). Both names do however appear for the monkey brothers in contemporary works such as the play `二郎神鎖齊天大聖` or the novella `陳從善梅嶺失渾家`. They are also found in an archaeological site on Baoshan mountain in [Shunchang, Fukien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunchang_County), known as the Twin Sages Tomb. it's located near the Southern Heaven Gate, a temple first built in 1391 and rebuilt in 1548, which some scholars argue are the upper and lower bounds for the tomb's age.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][3]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(順昌寶山雙聖墓 - Twin Sages Tomb, at Baoshan, Fukien)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The inscriptions are difficult to read from the photo, but the left is the [spirit tablet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_tablet) for a certain *Heaven Reaching Great Saint* (`通天大聖`), while the right is for the more familiar *Heaven Rivaling Great Saint*. The positioning (left is senior) and style of the steles matches the play's version that the *Heaven Reaching Great Saint* is the younger brother.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On this basis it is thought that the *Journey*'s character of Sun Wukong - and the monkey deity - is in fact **an amalgamation of both Great Sages and their sister, *Wu Zhiqi*.** That is in fact a considerably more ancient name, tracing back to at least ninth century. During the Tang Dynasty, [Li Gongzu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Gongzuo), a fantasy novelist who penned the famous [*Governor of Nanke*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor_of_Nanke), wrote that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;《唐·李公佐·古岳讀經》 禹理水，三至桐柏山，驚風走雷，石號木鳴，五伯擁川，天老肅兵，不能興。禹怒，召集百靈，搜命夔龍，桐柏千君長稽首請命，禹因囚鴻蒙氏、章商氏、兜盧氏、犁婁氏，乃獲淮渦水神，名無支祁，善應對言語，辨江淮之淺深、原隰之遠近。形若猿猴，縮鼻高額，青軀白首，金目雪牙，頸伸百尺，力逾九象，搏擊騰踔疾奔，輕利倏忽，聞視不可久，禹授之章律，不能制，授之鳥木由，不能制，授之庚辰，能制。鴟脾桓木魅水靈，山妖石怪，奔號聚繞，以數千載，庚辰以戰逐去，頸鎖大索，鼻穿金鈴，徙淮陰之龜山之足下&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; While trying to control the flood, [Yu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great) came to [Tongbai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tongbai_County) thrice ... [there he] captured the river god of [Huai](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huai_River). **It is named Wu Zichi and shaped like a money**, with a sunken forehead and tall nose, a green body and white face, golden eyes and white teeth ... With a chain tied around his neck, [the monkey] was imprisoned under the Turtle Mountain of Huai.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;While it might only be his own fictional invention, the story was collected into `戎幕閒談`, a compilation of strange tales by the Tang writer Wei Xuan (`韋絢`), as the explanation for a supposed incident he heard:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 時有漁人，夜釣於龜山之下，其釣因物所制，不複出。漁者健水，疾沉於下五十丈，見大鐵鎖，盤繞山足，尋不知極，遂告湯。湯命漁人及能水者數十，獲其獲，力莫能制，加以牛五十餘頭，鎖乃振動，稍稍就岸。時無風濤，驚浪翻湧，觀者大駭，鎖之末，見一獸，狀有如猿，白首長口，雪牙金爪，闖然上岸。高五丈許，蹲踞之狀若猿猴，但兩目不能開，兀若昏昧，目鼻水流如泉，涎沫腥穢，人不可近。久乃引頸伸欠，雙目忽開，光彩若電，顧視人焉，欲發狂怒，觀者奔走，獸亦徐徐引鎖，拽牛入水去，竟不複出&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A fisherman was fishing by the Turtle Mountain at night. His hook was caught on something and would not budge. Knowing how to swim, he dived in 50 yards, and saw a seemingly endless, large iron chain surrounding the foot of the mountain. He reported what he saw to the governor, who sent dozens of swimmers and more than 50 bulls to pull the chain out. There was no wind at the time, but to the shock of bystanders huge waves formed on the river. **At the end of the chain, there was a beast, shaped like a monkey/ape, white faced and long moused, white teeth and golden eyes.** He stumbled onto the shore, some five yards tall, moving like a monkey but with his eyes closed ... [after a while] his eyes suddenly opened, looking around like lightening, and looked around like he's about to go on a rampage. Everyone started running off, and he slowly walked back into the water, dragging the bulls with him, and vanished.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Furthermore, the Tang scholar Li Zhao records in his *Addendum to Tang Histories* (`唐國史補`) that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 楚州有漁人，忽于准中釣得古鐵鎖，挽之不絕，以告官。刺史李陽大集人力引之。鎖窮，有青獼猴躍出水，复沒而逝。後有驗《山海經》云：水獸好為害，禹鎖于軍山之下，其名曰無支奇&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A fisherman from Chu found an old iron chain in the Huai River. He pulled on it but it went on endlessly, so he reported it to the government. The governor gathered many men to pull. At the end of the chain, a green monkey lept out of the water, then vanished. Consulting the *Classics of Mountains and Seas* found a passage saying: A water beast was being a pest, and Yu locked it under the Jun Mountain. **Its name is Wu Zichi.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [*Classics of Mountains and Seas*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_of_Mountains_and_Seas) cited in the last passage is an ancient bestiary that dates back as far as the fourth century *B.C.*, but the extant versions do not contain this supposed quote. It is quite possible that this part is a fabrication - citing old documents lend credence to the story. Nonetheless, the numerous references to the story suggests that, while the specifics might be inventions of writers, the idea of a monkey river god was an established concept in Chinese folklore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Moreover, there are obvious parallels with the Sun Wukong character from the *Journey to the West*. The imprisonment under a mountain is particularly notable, and the physical description of the monkey Wu Zichi's golden eyes is an obvious precursor to Sun Wukong's fabled true seeing Flaming Eyes and Golden Iris (`火眼金睛`). These similarities are why Wu Zichi is widely considered the origin of Chinese folk religion's monkey deity, the Great Sage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An alternative school of thought argues that the Great Sage was inspired by the Hindu monkey god [Hanuman](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanuman). Whether a native Wu Zichi absorbed influences of Hanuman, or whether Wu Zichi itself was inspired by Hanuman, is a matter of some scholarly debate. Regardless of the true sequence of events, a tradition of a monkey deity most likely found itself transplanted from India into China. An (originally) [Tang](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty) era Hindu-Buddhist [Kaiyuan Temple](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaiyuan_Temple_(Quanzhou)) at [Zayton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quanzhou) contains a stone mural widely considered to depict Sun Wu Kong.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![enter image description here][2]  &#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;(泉州開元寺仁壽塔 - Renshou Pagoda, rebuilt in 1237, at the Kaiyuan Temple, Fukien.)&lt;/sup&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This &quot;Itinerant Monk Sun (Monkey)&quot;, as the mural is often called, predates *Journey to the West* by centuries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since the Ming Dynasty, Fukien has been a primary source of Chinese emigration and colonialisation. Unsurprisingly, veneration of the monkey god was transplanted by Hokkien settlers to Taiwan and South East Asia by Hokkien settlers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/qzS8w.gif&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/YbyFZ.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/fAYW6.jpg" />

Here is what he says about its relationship with the north star:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The top of the world pillar, or the world pillar as a whole, is identified with the polar star. Basic here is the observation that, in the northern sky, the stars revolve as if around a fixed point. It is believed that this point is the upper end of the world pillar, provided with an iron needle around which the sky circles. This needle is the mechanism for the rotation of the sky, and is thereby easily identified with the polar star.  &#xD;&#xA;The distribution of the pertinent traits shows that while the concept of the polar star as the fixed point of the world pillar seems to be common to the whole circumpolar area, the idea of the needle is only represented among Eurasian sub-Arctic peoples. [...]  &#xD;&#xA;The nail on the world column, or what we here conveniently could call the &quot;world nail&quot;, has apparently been a widely distributed Eurasian concept. All sources at our disposal hint that this nail was identical with the polar star. This holds for the Saamis, the Esthonians, the Samoyeds, the Chuckchee and the Koryak. It is furthermore most interesting that the polar star has been called world pillar. Thus, as Harva has noted, Mongols, Buryats, Kalmucks, Altai Tatars and Uigurs call the polar star &quot;the golden pillar&quot;, Kirghis, Bashgirs and other Tatars name it &quot;iron pillar&quot;, the Teleuts &quot;the lone post&quot; and the Orotchi (Tungus) &quot;the golden post&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for the origin of the concept, according to Hultkrantz:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The world pillar, we may insist, genuinely represents an archaic, circumpolar world view. Since circumpolar culture, besides being an adaptation to the Arctic and sub-Arctic environment, typifies a culture of mesolithic-palaeolithic origins it seems probable that the world pillar and associated mythic-ritual complex may be traced back to this time and age." />

The Graeae were 2-4 sisters who only had one eye (and one tooth) to share between them.  There is not any indication that means there was ever a loss of another 3-7 eyes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, Perseus stole their sole eye on his way to slay Medusa.  In the most well-known version of the myth today, the eye is then ransomed back to them for information.  However, is other versions of the myth, the eye was not returned, and Perseus merely took advantage of their blindness to pass by them:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;According to [Hyginus Astronomica](http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusAstronomica.html#12), the eye was not returned, but rather was cast into a nearby lake:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; They are thought to have had but one eye among them, and thus to have kept guard, watch one taking it in her turn. This eye Perseus snatches, as one was passing it to another, and threw is in Lake Tritonis. So, when the guards were blinded, he easily killed the Gorgon when she was overcome with sleep. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And similar according to [Ovid's Metamorphoses](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0028%3Abook%3D4%3Acard%3D706), while no mention of what became of the eye is given, it certainly doesn't seem to be returned to them:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There is a spot beneath cold Atlas, where in bulwarks of enormous strength, to guard its rocky entrance, dwelt two sisters, born of Phorcys. These were wont to share in turn a single eye between them: this by craft I got possession of, when one essayed to hand it to the other.—I put forth my hand and took it as it passed between: then, far, remote, through rocky pathless crags, over wild hills that bristled with great woods, I thence arrived to where the Gorgon dwelt.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems that the Graeae were almost certainly immortal ([2/3 of their other siblings, the gorgons, were, anyway](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/361/why-was-medusa-the-only-mortal-of-the-gorgons)), but whether they fit your definition of &quot;gods&quot; I can only leave to your judgement." />

Long before written records gods and their histories were alive in the myths of the people. As comparative myths show, similar to common roots in indoeuropean language , common roots can be seen in the [religions of the indoeuropean races.][1]. Changes and growth would be slow and not out of  random creativity, but of religious needs as the environment changed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Before the advent of Christianity in the region gods from other regions were not rejected, viz the altar in Athens to the &quot;unknown god&quot;  which apostle Paul used to take off his proselytizing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even Christianity, a proselytizing religion, took a few centuries to become the main religion, and even then, a lot of the rites and god attributes were transferred to the new saints.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The religious stance of the hoi polloi started in the home and in childhood and was a continuous narrative which can be embellished and changed but much more slowly than you imagine. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A week ago I went to a memorial service in a  village of about 2000 people in Greece.  About two hundred people were following the liturgy, children and adults, to kiss the icons and genuflect,  and communion taken by some as young as 15 yrs old, before the memorial part started. Religious feelings are strong, and can be manipulated by apocalyptic religions, as the take of Christianity shows, but it is a time consuming process. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apocalyptic religions, like the laws of Moses, and Christianity, and the advent of Mohamed seem to be the province of the Semitic line of culture. They obviously address a part of the human psyche strongly, but there is no indication in the Greek mythological records that there was any apocalyptic  act that generated the narrative of Olympus etc. (apocalyptic with the original meaning, sudden appearance).&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proto-Indo-European_religion" />

Early published versions were based on less complete information, and had to make assumptions that turned out incorrect, especially with regards to Dumuzi's (Tammuz) role in the story (See: Kramer's explanation of the decipherment in [this print version](http://www.amazon.com/Inanna-Queen-Heaven-Earth-Stories/dp/0060908548), and also [&quot;Tammuz and the Bible&quot;](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3265029)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;-----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I will be using [Wolkstein and Kramer's translation](http://www.amazon.com/Inanna-Queen-Heaven-Earth-Stories/dp/0060908548) of the text, published in 1983.  Both because it's excellent and well-explained, and because it's the one sitting on my desk.  [Full text here.](http://people.uncw.edu/deagona/myth/Descent%20Of%20Inanna.pdf)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, we could take Inanna (Ishtar) at her word.  Her overt reason is given:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inanna answered:  &#xD;&#xA;&quot;Because . . . of my older sister, Ereshkigal,  &#xD;&#xA;Her husband, Gugulanna, the Bull of Heaven, has died.  &#xD;&#xA;I have come to witness the funeral rites.  &#xD;&#xA;Let the beer of his funeral rites be poured into the cup.  &#xD;&#xA;Let it be done.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That, however, is just the excuse she gives at the gate.  It doesn't seem likely this is her real reason for the trip.  More likely the real reason is shown here:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which gives us the hint that she has heard the Great Below, the underworld, in some way.  Wolkstein's explanations, however, give us more to go on:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Inanna is the Queen of Heaven and Earth, but she does not know the underworld.  Until her ear opens to the Great Below, her understanding is necessarily limited.  In Sumerian, the word for ear and wisdom is the same ... In order to fully appreciate or &quot;know&quot;  what is said or meant, a great understanding is needed - an understanding of all things.  It is the Great Below, and knowledge of death and rebirth, life and stasis, that will make Inanna an &quot;Honored Counselor&quot; and a guide to the land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So Inanna, already powerful and knowledgeable of Heaven and Earth, needs to acquire knowledge of death and the underworld to be complete in her wisdom.  This is further supported later, from the statement of Enlil, when hearing that Inanna has not returned from the underworld:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;My daughter craved the Great Above.  &#xD;&#xA;Inanna craved the Great Below.  &#xD;&#xA;She who receives the *me* of the underworld does not return.  &#xD;&#xA;She who goes to the Dark City stays there.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here Enlil (and later, Nanna, in an identical statement) states that Inanna has gone seeking the *me* of the underworld.  [*me* is a tricky word](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/726/what-is-the-meaning-of-the-word-me-in-the-descent-of-inanna) that most translators refuse to translate, and too much can be said about it to address completely here.  Suffice to say, the *me* represent knowledge and wisdom.  So, the gods know that she has gone seeking that knowledge that can only be gained in the underworld.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To go just one more step, a *very popular* interpretation of the text is through a Jungian lens.  Just to hit the main points very briefly.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The goal of gaining wisdom of the underworld, to complement the wisdom of the heavens and of the earth, speaks of Inanna becoming complete, but this interpretation views it, instead of her completing her body of knowledge, she is completing herself, developing into a *whole* person (goddess).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this light, we see Inanna and her sister Ereshkigal as part of the same whole person.  In order to become complete, Inanna must become vulnerable, and face the dark side of herself (Ereshkigal), die and be reborn.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Inanna abandons her temples on the way to the underworld, and has to leave her crown, robe and other vestments (also *me*. Like I said, complicated) at the gates of the underworld.  She arrives naked, powerless and vulnerable.  The death and rebirth are fairly clear to be read, but of particular interest is that after Inanna's death, and preparing for rebirth, Ereshkigal is in pain &quot;With the cries of a woman about to give birth.&quot;  Which does rather speak to the interpretation of being reborn from her darker half." />

As such, its meaning is complex, and a lot has been written about both Aztec music in general and the specific meaning of the breaking of the flutes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most basic interpretation is that the breaking of the flutes simply represents the death of the sacrificial victim/avatar of the god on earth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What then do the flutes, flute playing, and the physical breaking of the flutes by the player himself signify? Not only is a painful death the end of the happiness of earth, but the flute also symbolizes all that is humanly and spiritually powerful, as Carrasco explains: &quot;The sound of the flute, as with the word, depends on the exhalation of the breath or, in Nahua thought, the soul.&quot; Therefore, the soul of the sacrificial victim who represented the &quot;god of gods&quot; is forever lost with his death and by his own breaking of the flutes that represented his soul.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Olsen, Dale A., [World Flutelore: Folktales, Myths, and Other Stories of Magical Flute Power][2].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is further supported by the fact that flutes were a metaphor for flowers, meaning that the act of breaking the flute was analogous to picking a flower (i.e. killing them, but preserving their &quot;essence&quot; like preserving a flower in a vase):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Furthermore, the particular Aztec ceramic duct flute... performed by the young impersonator of Tezcatlipoca is called a &quot;flower flute&quot; because it has a flared distal end that represents a flower blossom. Furthermore, the flower... symbolizes beauty, blood offering, and music, according to Arnd Adje Both:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&gt; Indeed, the heart of a deity impersonator itself was compared to a flower, metaphorically &quot;plucked&quot; and offered in ritual human sacrifice. Analogously the impersonator &quot;plucked&quot; the flutes before his own death, as symbolized in breaking the bells from the tube over the stairway and leaving them as undamaged as possible. This act of ritual destruction is clearly evident by organological data and could be interpreted as a process of transformation into the spiritual realm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Olsen][3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some pictures of the flower shaped flutes used in the ritual (from [Arnd Adje Both's fantastic pdf about the instruments][5]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Drawings of Aztec flutes.][4]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Aztec flute playing posture.][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another interpretation focuses on the use of music to communicate with the gods. In fact:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Some musical instruments were considered to be sounding idols, indicating that ritual music could be perceived as a voice of the gods, and that the Aztec instrumentalist fulfilled the role of an expert mediator through whom a god sang. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Both, Arnd Adje, [Aztec Music Culture][7].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The importance of music is further emphasized by the myths that discuss the origin of music. In Central American myths, music is stolen from gods (often with the help of Tezcatlipoca, and gives humans the power to communicate with the spiritual realm:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An interesting myth... related that originally music was the property of the sun. After the sacrifice of the gods in Teotihuacan, men gathered their remains and made sacred bundles out of them, but they did not know how to adore them. Tezcatlipoca created Ehecatl (Wind), whom he entrusted with the task of going to the house of the sun to bring the musicians there to the earth. Water goddesses, the nieces of Tezcatlipoca, build a bridge [sic] so that Ehecatl could reach the abode of the sun. The musicians were warned not to answer the intruder with the &quot;mellifluous song,&quot; but in spite of these warnings, one of the musicians succumbed to the charm of the song and followed the envoy of Tezcatlipoca. That was the origin of music and prayers on the earth, thanks to which men could adore the gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Popol Vuh, the noise of the ball game provokes the ire of the underworld masters of Xibalba; several modern myths give the same function to the song and music played by the hero... Thus the noise from the ball game, smoke, and music all have parallel functions. They manifest the acquisition of cultural goods, which constitute a king of usurpation of the power of the creator gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Oliver, Guilhem, [The Hidden King and the Broken Flutes: the Mythical and Royal Dimension of Tezcatlipoca's Feast in Toxcatl][8].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is also supported by the Aztec connection between flowers and music (which we've previously discussed when comparing the shape of the flutes to flowers). The scent of flowers and the sound of music are analogous in Aztec culture, as both allow humans to communicate with their deities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Aztec concept of music as a “flowery song” is reflected in the calyx-shape of the flower-flute. To play it allows to visualize the metaphorical link between sound and the scent of blossoms, both regarded as sacrificial gifts functioning as a means of communication with the spiritual realm, probably because of their invisible sensual quality. That the ruler was compared to the flute, through which Tezcatlipoca could express his will, makes the important social function of the instrument evident and shows that instrumental sound was perceived as the proper voice or ‘flowery song’ of a deity. Thus, the flutist fulfilled the role of a mediator. It can be proposed that he was sacrificed instead of the ruler.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Both, Arnd Adje. [Aztec Flower-Flutes: The Symbolic Organization of Sound in Late Postclassic Mesoamerica][9].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, breaking of the flutes represents a pause in communication with the gods, which is then reinstated after the sacrifice occurs. (I think it's also reasonable to interpret the breaking of the flutes as briefly returning the gift of music to the gods, and thereby thanking them for said gift.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Recall that in the myth the envoy-counterpart of Tezcatlipoca descended from the abode of the sun and offered music to the people so that they could adore their gods. In the ritual, the representative of Tezcatlipoca returned toward the sun [i.e. walked back up the temple] and broke the flutes. By breaking them on the temple steps, he foresaw his own death by becoming one with the instrument. With his death the possibility of contact with the god was broken, and only with the coming of a new representative would it be possible to reestablish a link between gods and humans. The king could then leave his retreat, and the sound of flutes would again make the presence of the god known in the city.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Oliver][10].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet another interpretation looks at the ritual through the lens of [Aztec and Central American ideas about the soul and human nature][11]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The sacrifice of the youth was linked to the profound philosophical idea that only the true, the deified heart is worthy to become nourishment for the great start that maintains life on earth. The Nahua peoples believed that we are born with a physical heart and face, but that we have to create a deified heart and a true face.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Nicholson, Irene. *Mexican and Central American Mythology*.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The ceremony was a myth acted out in real life. The myth was about man, who must learn to glorify god through sensual things, through fine clothes and music and dance, before he is worthy of breaking the senses one by one and losing his life in order to gain it.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Nicholson.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This interpretation of the breaking of the flutes reminds me of the following quote about art:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The poet and critic Allen Grossman tells a story (there are many versions of the story) that goes like this: you’re moved to write a poem because of some transcendent impulse to get beyond the human, the historical, the finite. But as soon as you move from that impulse to the actual poem, the song of the infinite is compromised by the finitude of its terms. So the poem is always a record of failure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Lerner, Ben. [On Disliking Poetry][12])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And now we've come full circle: a reason why flutes are so important is that music allows humans to express themselves.

As such, its meaning is complex, and a lot has been written about both Aztec music in general and the specific meaning of the breaking of the flutes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The most basic interpretation is that the breaking of the flutes simply represents the death of the sacrificial victim/avatar of the god on earth:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; What then do the flutes, flute playing, and the physical breaking of the flutes by the player himself signify? Not only is a painful death the end of the happiness of earth, but the flute also symbolizes all that is humanly and spiritually powerful, as Carrasco explains: &quot;The sound of the flute, as with the word, depends on the exhalation of the breath or, in Nahua thought, the soul.&quot; Therefore, the soul of the sacrificial victim who represented the &quot;god of gods&quot; is forever lost with his death and by his own breaking of the flutes that represented his soul.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Olsen, Dale A., [World Flutelore: Folktales, Myths, and Other Stories of Magical Flute Power][2].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is further supported by the fact that flutes were a metaphor for flowers, meaning that the act of breaking the flute was analogous to picking a flower (i.e. killing them, but preserving their &quot;essence&quot; like preserving a flower in a vase):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Furthermore, the particular Aztec ceramic duct flute... performed by the young impersonator of Tezcatlipoca is called a &quot;flower flute&quot; because it has a flared distal end that represents a flower blossom. Furthermore, the flower... symbolizes beauty, blood offering, and music, according to Arnd Adje Both:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&gt; Indeed, the heart of a deity impersonator itself was compared to a flower, metaphorically &quot;plucked&quot; and offered in ritual human sacrifice. Analogously the impersonator &quot;plucked&quot; the flutes before his own death, as symbolized in breaking the bells from the tube over the stairway and leaving them as undamaged as possible. This act of ritual destruction is clearly evident by organological data and could be interpreted as a process of transformation into the spiritual realm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Olsen][3]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here are some pictures of the flower shaped flutes used in the ritual (from [Arnd Adje Both's fantastic pdf about the instruments][5]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Drawings of Aztec flutes.][4]][5]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![Aztec flute playing posture.][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another interpretation focuses on the use of music to communicate with the gods. In fact:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Some musical instruments were considered to be sounding idols, indicating that ritual music could be perceived as a voice of the gods, and that the Aztec instrumentalist fulfilled the role of an expert mediator through whom a god sang. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Both, Arnd Adje, [Aztec Music Culture][1].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The importance of music is further emphasized by the myths that discuss the origin of music. In Central American myths, music is stolen from gods (often with the help of Tezcatlipoca, and gives humans the power to communicate with the spiritual realm:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An interesting myth... related that originally music was the property of the sun. After the sacrifice of the gods in Teotihuacan, men gathered their remains and made sacred bundles out of them, but they did not know how to adore them. Tezcatlipoca created Ehecatl (Wind), whom he entrusted with the task of going to the house of the sun to bring the musicians there to the earth. Water goddesses, the nieces of Tezcatlipoca, build a bridge [sic] so that Ehecatl could reach the abode of the sun. The musicians were warned not to answer the intruder with the &quot;mellifluous song,&quot; but in spite of these warnings, one of the musicians succumbed to the charm of the song and followed the envoy of Tezcatlipoca. That was the origin of music and prayers on the earth, thanks to which men could adore the gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Popol Vuh, the noise of the ball game provokes the ire of the underworld masters of Xibalba; several modern myths give the same function to the song and music played by the hero... Thus the noise from the ball game, smoke, and music all have parallel functions. They manifest the acquisition of cultural goods, which constitute a king of usurpation of the power of the creator gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Oliver, Guilhem, [The Hidden King and the Broken Flutes: the Mythical and Royal Dimension of Tezcatlipoca's Feast in Toxcatl][8].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is also supported by the Aztec connection between flowers and music (which we've previously discussed when comparing the shape of the flutes to flowers). The scent of flowers and the sound of music are analogous in Aztec culture, as both allow humans to communicate with their deities.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Aztec concept of music as a “flowery song” is reflected in the calyx-shape of the flower-flute. To play it allows to visualize the metaphorical link between sound and the scent of blossoms, both regarded as sacrificial gifts functioning as a means of communication with the spiritual realm, probably because of their invisible sensual quality. That the ruler was compared to the flute, through which Tezcatlipoca could express his will, makes the important social function of the instrument evident and shows that instrumental sound was perceived as the proper voice or ‘flowery song’ of a deity. Thus, the flutist fulfilled the role of a mediator. It can be proposed that he was sacrificed instead of the ruler.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Both, Arnd Adje. [Aztec Flower-Flutes: The Symbolic Organization of Sound in Late Postclassic Mesoamerica][9].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, breaking of the flutes represents a pause in communication with the gods, which is then reinstated after the sacrifice occurs. (I think it's also reasonable to interpret the breaking of the flutes as briefly returning the gift of music to the gods, and thereby thanking them for said gift.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Recall that in the myth the envoy-counterpart of Tezcatlipoca descended from the abode of the sun and offered music to the people so that they could adore their gods. In the ritual, the representative of Tezcatlipoca returned toward the sun [i.e. walked back up the temple] and broke the flutes. By breaking them on the temple steps, he foresaw his own death by becoming one with the instrument. With his death the possibility of contact with the god was broken, and only with the coming of a new representative would it be possible to reestablish a link between gods and humans. The king could then leave his retreat, and the sound of flutes would again make the presence of the god known in the city.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Oliver][10].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Yet another interpretation looks at the ritual through the lens of [Aztec and Central American ideas about the soul and human nature][11]. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The sacrifice of the youth was linked to the profound philosophical idea that only the true, the deified heart is worthy to become nourishment for the great start that maintains life on earth. The Nahua peoples believed that we are born with a physical heart and face, but that we have to create a deified heart and a true face.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Nicholson, Irene. *Mexican and Central American Mythology*.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The ceremony was a myth acted out in real life. The myth was about man, who must learn to glorify god through sensual things, through fine clothes and music and dance, before he is worthy of breaking the senses one by one and losing his life in order to gain it.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Nicholson.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This interpretation of the breaking of the flutes reminds me of the following quote about art:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The poet and critic Allen Grossman tells a story (there are many versions of the story) that goes like this: you’re moved to write a poem because of some transcendent impulse to get beyond the human, the historical, the finite. But as soon as you move from that impulse to the actual poem, the song of the infinite is compromised by the finitude of its terms. So the poem is always a record of failure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Lerner, Ben. [On Disliking Poetry][12])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And now we've come full circle: a reason why flutes are so important is that music allows humans to express themselves. Breaking a flute is the equivalent to killing someone as they can not speak nor communicate with the gods. However, the breaking of the flute also represents both an interruption of divine communication *and* (as argued by Nicholson) an attempt at a rebirth into a realm where flutes aren't necessary, because there is direct communication with the spiritual realm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Of course, none of that theology makes the human sacrifices performed by the Aztecs ethical, but it helps us understand their perspective better.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/41699767&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://books.google.com/books?id=3bUPBAAAQBAJ&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://books.google.com/books?id=3bUPBAAAQBAJ&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/4yOFP.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.mixcoacalli.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/both_2002.PDF &quot;This source also contains technical details behind the \&quot;flower-flutes\&quot;.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/xFCZH.png&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://books.google.com/books?id=3bUPBAAAQBAJ&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: https://www.academia.edu/8645965/_The_Hidden_King_and_the_Broken_Flutes_the_Mythical_and_Royal_Dimension_of_Tezcatlipocas_Feast_in_Toxcatl_en_Representing_Ritual_Performance_Text_and_Image_in_the_Work_of_Sahag%C3%BAn_Eloise_Qui%C3%B1ones_Keber_coord._Niwat_University_of_Colorado_Press_2002_pp._107-142&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.mixcoacalli.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/both_2002.PDF &quot;This source also contains technical details behind the \&quot;flower-flutes\&quot;.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: https://www.academia.edu/8645965/_The_Hidden_King_and_the_Broken_Flutes_the_Mythical_and_Royal_Dimension_of_Tezcatlipocas_Feast_in_Toxcatl_en_Representing_Ritual_Performance_Text_and_Image_in_the_Work_of_Sahag%C3%BAn_Eloise_Qui%C3%B1ones_Keber_coord._Niwat_University_of_Colorado_Press_2002_pp._107-142&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://www.iep.utm.edu/aztec/&#xD;&#xA;  [12]: http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n12/ben-lerner/diary" />

These are old traditional folk dance/theatrical rituals which are known to have been performed at least as early as in the Middle Ages, though it's not known exactly how the plays/dances looked back them. But the versions that are still performed are documented at least in the mid-1800's.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Wikipedia][1] says &#xD;&#xA;&gt;Although usually broadly comic performances, the plays seem to be based on underlying themes of duality and resurrection and generally involve a battle between two or more characters, perhaps representing good against evil. Usually they feature a doctor who has a magic potion which is able to resuscitate a slain character. It is interesting to note that even though the quack doctor performed witchcraft in a largely catholic country, he was still a widely accepted and beloved character. Early scholars of folk drama, influenced by James Frazer's The Golden Bough, tended to view these plays as debased versions of a pre-Christian fertility ritual, but some modern researchers discount this view preferring a late mediaeval origin (for which there is no evidence either).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are as many versions of the plays as there are places where they're performed, possibly more. But in their essence they are about death and resurrection, and they are performed at times of renewal such as the New year or the harvest (as in the movie).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The three characters are &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. &quot;The Fool&quot; - he's the one who becomes &quot;king for a day&quot; and is then cut down.

The prose of such prophecies is that the prophet sees everything unfold in a vision, so from his perspective, it did happen.

For example, Loki brings the giants together to fight against the gods in the final battle of Ragnarok, which results in the Earth's destruction by fire. In Revelation, the Devil amasses an army of demons and wicked humans to fight against God and his angels in the battle of Armageddon. The world is also destroyed by fire, although by the will of God, rather than as a result of the battle. A new Earth is also made in both myths.

In a myth involving a character named Baldr (who was certainly influenced by Christian depictions of Jesus), Loki is an evil specimen that murders Baldr out of jealousy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When they capture Loki, he is held in a prison until Ragnarok (the Norse apocalypse that was also likely influenced by Christianity) and tortured by having a perpetual stream of snake venom drip into is face.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Loki's evil nature and jealousy (of a Christ like image especially) and his ultimate tortuous imprisonment was undoubtedly influenced by Christian perceptions of Satan.** In Christian mythology, Satan is evil. And the eschatology (apocalyptic theology) revolving around him involves an eternity of torment, which is undoubtedly because of his heinous misdeeds against God, humanity, and the rest of creation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This progression for trickster gods to take on a darker persona as the centuries pass is actually quite common (Satan in Job, for example, is not necessarily evil, but is certainly an accuser and adversary, but by Revelation he *is* patently evil). It is therefore expected that Loki would become more like Satan as Christianity influenced the Norse mythos, because Satan had already progressed into a personification of evil centuries earlier. Without Christian influence, Loki still likely would have become more evil and less trickster, so the rising influence of Christianity in Norse areas and Loki's conversion to an evil character may have been coincidental, however it does seem likely that Christianity at least hastened the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;SOURCES&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. [*Lucifer: The Devil in the Middle Ages*][1] - &quot;The parallels between Loki and Satan are striking but are for the most part Christian coloring of paganism rather than the opposite.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;2. [*The Trickster, the Devil, and an Ambiguous World* - The Anthropik Network][3] - &quot;It’s fairly easy to divide stories about Loki into two historical categories: pre-Christianity, and post-Christianity.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;3. [*A Brief History of the Vikings*][4] - &quot;By the [10th century], Loki had perhaps been influenced by several centuries of Christian lore, and was now seen as a far more devilish figure that he may originally have been.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;4. *[Archetypes and Motifs in Folklore and Literature][5]* - &quot;Tales of Loki's evil and binding are clearly influenced by the later Christian identification of Loki and the Devil (tricksters, perhaps because of their profane character, are often equated with the Devil if their original culture is converted to Christianity).&quot;&#xD;&#xA;5. [*Völuspá* - New Advent][2] - &quot;Balder, the innocent god, is treacherously slain through the machinations of the wicked Loki.&quot; and &quot;Christian influence is not only possible, but certain.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;6. [Viking Religion - BBC History][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;NOTES&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. [*A New Place for Loki, Part II* on Polytheist.com][7] states that &quot;since Loki was a deity who I believe was originally responsible for carrying burnt sacrifices to the gods and freeing the souls of the dead via cremation, it is only natural that the Catholic Church would have found him particularly deplorable.&quot; There are many sources for the article, but I have not looked through them. There is a certain level of sense to the claim, but without vetting it, the source finds itself in the notes section instead.&#xD;&#xA;2.

She is not depicted favorably - as a magical figure who, to put it one way, reacts poorly to failure. She really only appears in the first part of the story; her role leads to the life of Taliesin, the main character. her name, however, sounds quite similar to that of the Korrigans. Given that mythological names can change over time, she could be an important precursor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*[The Lady of the Fountain](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/mab/mab05.htm)* is a tale of King Arthur, also related to a French poem, *Ywain, or, The Knight with the Lion*. It features (of course) the Lady of the Fountain, also referred to as the Countess of the Fountain. She does not appear to directly have any magical powers, but the Fountain does - at least in the story of Ywain. In this tale, she is named [Laudine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudine). The important tie here is that in the French version (as well, I think as the Arthurian), the Lady hails from Gaul or Brittany.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[The Lady of the Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake) is, of course, a central character in the stories of King Arthur (though there are some odd discrepancies; I would be indebted to anyone who can answer [this](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/479/is-there-any-relationship-between-the-ladies-of-the-lake)). I think that while the etymological argument in favor of Ceridwen being the influence is strong, there is also a very good argument to be made for the Lady of the Lake in Avalon. She is described as having eight other sisters; this is quite consistent with the nine Korrigans Keightley refers to as existing on some versions of the myth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each character has one or more chief similarities to the Korrigans, aside from any magical powers and other defining characteristics. For Ceridwen, it is the name. For the Lady of the Fountain, it is that she hails from Gaul or Brittany. For the Lady of the Lake, it is that she is one of nine sisters. It does seem likely that the Korrigans are composites of the three, meaning that the Korrigans did not appear in Breton folklore at a particular time, but were corruptions of earlier tales." />

The four Yugas known as Satya, Treta, Dwapara, and Kali together make up one Mahayuga, and a thousand Mahayugas make up one Kalpa or day of Brahma.  But in addition to being divided into 1000 Mahayugas, a Kalpa is also divided into fourteen Manvantaras, each of which is made up of about 71 Mahayugas.  We're currently living in the seventh Manvantara of the present Kalpa, known as the Vaivasvata Manavantara, and we're living in the 28th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now that we have some background, in [this chapter][1] of the Matsya Purana (an important Hindu scripture), various incarnations of Vishnu in the present Vaivasvata Manvantara are described.  But Kalki is only mentioned once, and that is in the current Kali Yuga.  [This excerpt][2] from the Skanda Purana says the same thing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And we can find explicit references to how Kali Yugas have ended in the past.  In particular, [this chapter][3] of the famous Hindu epic the Mahabharata describes how Vishnu's incarnation Parashurama brought about the end of the 19th Kali Yuga of the Vaivasvata Manvantara by killing the kings of the world:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Even the great ascetic Rama, the hero worshipped by all heroes, that son of Jamadagni, of great fame, will die, without being contented (with the period of his life). **Rooting out all evils from the earth, he caused the primeval Yuga to set in.** Having obtained unrivalled prosperity, no fault could be seen in him. His father having been slain and his calf having been stolen by the Kshatriyas, he without any boast, slew Kartavirya who had never been vanquished before by foes. With his bow he slew four and sixty times ten thousand Kshatriyas already within the jaws of death. In that slaughter were included fourteen thousand Brahmana-hating Kshatriyas of the Dantakura country, all of whom he slew. Of the Haihayas, he slew a thousand with his short club, a thousand with his sword, and a thousand by hanging. Heroic warriors, with their cars, steeds, and elephants, lay dead on the field, slain by the wise son of Jamadagni, enraged at the slaughter of his father. And Rama, on that occasion, slew ten thousand Kshatriyas with his axe. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, as far as I know there was only one other occasion where Vishnu took a Kalki incarnation.  The Kalki incarnation was named Pramati, and he seems to have lived in the Swayambhuva Manvantara, the first Manvantara of the present Kalpa.  (The Kalki incarnation who is going to come in present Kali Yuga will be named Vishnuyasha.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By the way, if you're interested in those lists of Vaivasvata Manvantara incarnations found in the Matsya and Skanda Puranas, I've posted a few questions about them on Hinduism.SE, [here][4], [here][5], and [here][6].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.com/books?id=nckrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%2224th%20treta%22&amp;pg=PA138#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.indianscriptures.com/Content/Articles/PDFs/27478/62f_chapter_19_2.pdf#toolbar=0&amp;pagemode=none&amp;view=FitBH&amp;page=1%22&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://Even%20the%20great%20ascetic%20Rama,%20the%20hero%20worshipped%20by%20all%20heroes,%20that%20son%20of%20Jamadagni,%20of%20great%20fame,%20will%20die,%20without%20being&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7192/36&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7194/36&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://hinduism.stackexchange.com/q/7221/36" />

Before the rest he set flesh and inner parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox paunch; [540] but for Zeus he put the white bones dressed up with cunning art and covered with shining fat. Then the father of men and of gods said to him: “Son of Iapetus, most glorious of all lords, good sir, how unfairly you have divided the portions!”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [545] So said Zeus whose wisdom is everlasting, rebuking him. But wily Prometheus answered him, smiling softly and not forgetting his cunning trick: “Zeus, most glorious and greatest of the eternal gods, take which ever of these portions your heart within you bids.” [550] So he said, thinking trickery. But Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he took up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his spirit [555] when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out: and because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars.

Then said Ganglere: Where is the chief or most holy place of the gods? Har answered: That is by the ash Ygdrasil. There the gods meet in council every day. Said Ganglere: What is said about this place?

But under the second root, which extends to the frost-giants, is the well of Mimer, wherein knowledge and wisdom are concealed.** The owner of the well hight Mimer. He is full of wisdom, for he drinks from the well with the Gjallar-horn. Alfather once came there and asked for a drink from the well, but he did not get it before he left one of his eyes as a pledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That indicates that the frost giants live &quot;where Giningagap formerly was&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From verse 43,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When the builder saw that his work was not going to be completed, he resumed his giant form. When the asas thus became sure that it was really a mountain-giant that had come among them, they did not heed their oaths, but called on Thor. **He came straightaway, swung his hammer, Mjolner, and paid the workman his wages,.---not with the sun and moon, but rather by preventing him from dwelling in Jotunheim; and this was easily done with the first blow of the hammer, which broke his skull into small pieces and sent him down to Niflhel.** But Loke had run such a race with Svadilfare that he some time after bore a foal. It was gray, and had eight feet, and this is the best horse among gods and men.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For at least one mountain-giant, Niflhel became home.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [another article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunn#Ragnar.C3.B6k_and_the_fire_j.C3.B6tnar), Wikipedia says,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **A certain class of jötnar are the fire jötnar (Múspellsmegir, &quot;sons of Muspell&quot;, or eldjötnar), said to reside in Muspelheim, the world of heat and fire, ruled by the fire jötunn Surtr (&quot;the black one&quot;).** The main role of the fire jötnar in Norse mythology is to wreak the final destruction of the world by setting fire to it at the end of Ragnarök, when the jötnar of Jotunheim and the forces of Hel shall launch an attack on the gods, and kill all but a few of them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This makes sense, as Muspelheim is the counterpart of Niflheim (fire vs. ice).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said, [Jötunheimr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6tunheimr) and [Útgarðar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9Atgar%C3%B0ar) are also homes of giants (with the former being more important).

[This](http://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/giants/ymir/) says that Ymer (Ymir) was formed from the meeting of Niflheim and Muspelheim, indicating that those are the first homes of the giants (because Ymer was the first being)." />

She is not depicted favorably - as a magical figure who, to put it one way, reacts poorly to failure. She really only appears in the first part of the story; her role leads to the life of Taliesin, the main character. her name, however, sounds quite similar to that of the Korrigans. Given that mythological names can change over time, she could be an important precursor.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*[The Lady of the Fountain](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/mab/mab05.htm)* is a tale of King Arthur, also related to a French poem, *Ywain, or, The Knight with the Lion*. It features (of course) **the Lady of the Fountain**, also referred to as the **Countess of the Fountain**. She does not appear to directly have any magical powers, but the Fountain does - at least in the story of Ywain. In this tale, she is named **[Laudine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laudine)**. The important tie here is that in the French version (as well, I think as the Arthurian), the Lady hails from Gaul or Brittany.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**[The Lady of the Lake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_of_the_Lake)** is, of course, a central character in the stories of King Arthur (though there are some odd discrepancies; I would be indebted to anyone who can answer [this](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/479/is-there-any-relationship-between-the-ladies-of-the-lake)). I think that while the etymological argument in favor of Ceridwen being the influence is strong, there is also a very good argument to be made for the Lady of the Lake in Avalon. She is described as having eight other sisters; this is quite consistent with the nine Korrigans Keightley refers to as existing on some versions of the myth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Each character has one or more chief similarities to the Korrigans, aside from any magical powers and other defining characteristics. For Ceridwen, it is the name. For the Lady of the Fountain, it is that she hails from Gaul or Brittany. For the Lady of the Lake, it is that she is one of nine sisters. It does seem likely that the Korrigans are composites of the three, meaning that the Korrigans did not appear in Breton folklore at a particular time, but were corruptions of earlier tales." />

She buried by night her brother Polynices, against the positive orders of Creon, who, when he heard of it, ordered her to be buried alive.

Look under Lewis and Short II.C to see that canere (the ultimate root of enchant &gt; incantare &gt; in + cantare = frequentative of canere) was often used in Latin for spells.

For the power of music over humans, one need not look much further than Demodocus in the Odyssey whose singing made Odysseus weep (8.62-67). Furthermore, song, especially formal epic song, always began with an invocation to the Muses, daughters of Apollo and thus song was both religious and prophetic (remember Apollo was the god of prophecy, among other things).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For Hesiod, not only do is the poet a &quot;servant of the Muse&quot; (Hes. *Th.* 100), but the &quot;divine gift&quot; (*Th.* 93) of the Muse allows the poet to speak of things of the past and the future: &quot;they breathed a divine voice into me, so that I might glorify what will be and what was before (*Th*. 32).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources: Apart from Hesiod and Homer, good starts would be Stoddard's &quot;The Programmatic Message of the &quot;Kings and Singers&quot; Passage: Hesiod, &quot;Theogony&quot; 80-103&quot; in *TAPhA* 133 (2003): 1-16.

Before the rest he set flesh and inner parts thick with fat upon the hide, covering them with an ox paunch; [540] but for Zeus he put the white bones dressed up with cunning art and covered with shining fat. Then the father of men and of gods said to him: “Son of Iapetus, most glorious of all lords, good sir, how unfairly you have divided the portions!”&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [545] So said Zeus whose wisdom is everlasting, rebuking him. But wily Prometheus answered him, smiling softly and not forgetting his cunning trick: “Zeus, most glorious and greatest of the eternal gods, take which ever of these portions your heart within you bids.” [550] So he said, thinking trickery. But Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, saw and failed not to perceive the trick, and in his heart he thought mischief against mortal men which also was to be fulfilled. With both hands he took up the white fat and was angry at heart, and wrath came to his spirit [555] when he saw the white ox-bones craftily tricked out: and because of this the tribes of men upon earth burn white bones to the deathless gods upon fragrant altars. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Translated by Hugh G.

Shiva gets white, black or blue skin in different places, Vishnu goes through black, blue, red and green in different texts, and so on. One of Vishnu's avatars, Krishna, actually directly translates to &quot;the dark-skinned one&quot;, but even he usually gets blue-skin in illustrations, as the question mentions. (My theory is that this is actually linguistic misunderstanding: the original Sanskrit calls him &quot;neela&quot; coloured, which back then refered to any dark colour, black or dark blue or dark green; by the time of these illustrations though, the common languages had &quot;neela&quot; meaning just blue.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reasons for this can be given from two viewpoints:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* from a historical view, the reason there's so much variation is (a) these texts were generally written by poets in the Bhakthi tradition, which is all about emotion and personal connection with God rather than analytical accuracy (b) Hinduism has absorbed various local beliefs through time, and allowed them all place within itself, turning those regional Gods into forms of the original Hindu Gods (so for eg. when Maariyamma மாரியம்மா a Tamil regional Goddess was taken in as a form of Goddess Parvati, Parvati acquired her dark skin as one of her colours). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* from a philosophical view, it is a constant reminder to not get attached to the form of the God, that names and forms (Naama-Roopa) - even those of Gods - are only products of Maya, and the Truth is beyond such limitations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

If any one unwarily draws in too close and hears the singing of the Sirens, his wife and children will never welcome him home again, for they sit in a green field and warble him to death with the sweetness of their song. There is a great heap of dead men's bones lying all around, with the flesh still rotting off them. Therefore pass these Sirens by, and **stop your men's ears with wax** that none of them may hear; **but if you like you can listen yourself**, for you may get the men to bind you as you stand upright on a cross-piece half way up the mast, and they must lash the rope's ends to the mast itself, that you may have the pleasure of listening. If you beg and pray the men to unloose you, then they must bind you faster.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(*Od*. 12.158-164)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;First she said we were to keep clear of the Sirens, who sit and sing most beautifully in a field of flowers; **but she said I might hear them myself so long as no one else did. Therefore, take me and bind me** to the crosspiece half way up the mast; bind me as I stand upright, with a bond so fast that I cannot possibly break away, and lash the rope's ends to the mast itself. If I beg and pray you to set me free, then bind me more tightly still.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The essential logic is that Circe said ordered him to be bound *if* he wanted to hear it. Odysseus relayed these instructions to his men, and therefore he must have wanted to hear the song.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Secondly, the word for wax here is κηρός [kēros], which is bees-wax.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just in case you had learned a different ancient version that was not the *Odyssey*, I checked Ps.-Apollodorus' version, and it merely summarizes Homer's version without any variants:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Pseudo-Apollodorus, *Bibliotecha*, E.7.19](http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApollodorusE.html#7)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sailing by them, Ulysses [i.e. Odysseus] wished to hear their song, so by Circe's advice he stopped the ears of his comrades with wax, and ordered that he should himself be bound to the mast. And being persuaded by the Sirens to linger, he begged to be released, but they bound him the more, and so he sailed past." />

(My theory is that this is actually linguistic misunderstanding: the original Sanskrit calls him &quot;neela&quot; coloured, which back then refered to any dark colour, black or dark blue or dark green; by the time of these illustrations though, the common languages had &quot;neela&quot; meaning just blue.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The reasons for this can be given from two viewpoints:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* from a historical view, the reason there's so much variation is (a) these texts were generally written by poets in the Bhakthi tradition, which is all about emotion and personal connection with God rather than analytical accuracy (b) Hinduism has absorbed various local beliefs through time, and allowed them all place within itself, turning those regional Gods into forms of the original Hindu Gods (so for eg. when Maariyamma மாரியம்மா a Tamil regional Goddess was taken in as a form of Goddess Parvati, Parvati acquired her dark skin as one of her colours). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* from a philosophical view, it is a constant reminder to not get attached to the form of the God, that names and forms (Naama-Roopa) - even those of Gods - are only products of Maya, and the Truth is beyond such limitations. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

The most famous was the Calydonian Boar Hunt. This one is a bit more difficult in the ancient details, since no epic exists of it. Nevertheless, it is attested as early as the Iliad.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, all primary sources for it can be found on [Theoi](http://theoi.com). I'll list the main ones.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Homer, *Iliad* 9.543ff.&#xD;&#xA; - Hesiod, *Catalogue of Women*, fr. 98&#xD;&#xA; - Ps.-Apollodorus, *Bibliotecha*, 1.66&#xD;&#xA; - Ovid, *Metamorphoses*, 8.269&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The point was to kill an oversized boar which was ravaging the land around Calydon. The king, Oenaus, put a bounty out on it, and the most famous Greek heroes of the time (barring Heracles) joined in, including:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Meleager, son of Oenaus, and the subject&#xD;&#xA; - Castor and Pollux, twin sons of Zeus (though one was said to be born of his mortal father Tyndareus); these two were always adventuring about, and they also joined in the Argonaut quest (they're also the &quot;Gemini&quot; in the sky);&#xD;&#xA; - Jason, leader of the Argonauts as outlined by Yannis;&#xD;&#xA; - Iolaus, most famously known as the side-kick of Heracles;&#xD;&#xA; - Peleus, father of Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior to fight in the Trojan War;&#xD;&#xA; - Theseus, slayer of the Minotaur and hero of Athens;&#xD;&#xA; - Atalanta, with whom Meleager fell in love; also known as the quickest woman in the ancient world, and the only woman ever mentioned in these adventures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The prime hero of the story is Meleager, and this adventuring ultimately led to his demise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Ps.-Apollodorus, *Bibliotecha* 1.66, translated by Aldrich with emendations by me)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When they had gathered, Oeneus entertained them for nine days. On the tenth day, Kepheus and Ankaios and some of the others refused contemptuously to go out hunting with a woman [i.e. Atalanta], but Meleager...wanted to make a child with Atalanta, and so compelled the men to join the hunt with her. When they had encircled the boar, the animal killed Hyleus and Ankaios, and Peleus accidentally speared Eurytion [king of Phthia] with his javelin. Atalanta was first to hit the boar, in the back with an arrow. Amphiaraus then got it in the eye, and Meleager killed it with a blow on the flank. When he received the skin, he gave it to Atalanta. But the sons of Thestius, who considered it disgraceful that a woman should get the trophy where men were involved, took the skin from her, saying that it was properly theirs by right of birth, if Meleager chose not to accept it. Outraged by this, Meleager slew them and again gave the skin to Atalanta. But Althaea, in grief over the death of her brothers, set fire to the brand [that the Fates declared when consumed would end the life of Meleager, otherwise he would have lived forever], and Meleager died on the spot.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another variant preserved by Ovid's *Metamorphoses* is that Meleager instead killed his brothers Plexippus and Toxeus, who were the ones that took it from Atalanta. This makes better sense out of the &quot;birthright&quot; claim." />

Gods are the children of the Titans. Specifically, Zeus was born from Cronus and Rea. Since Cronus feared that some time his childrens would try to seize power, he would eat them, but Rea managed to save Zeus and he tried to seize power when he grew up.

Surely we must have, at least at some layer, some etiological myth that explains why the ancient Hebrews used lambs, bulls, and birds for sacrifices instead of more mundane objects like vegetables.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Others have noted that it may preserve a tradition of backlash against the introduction of agriculture in the region.

If the offerer is defiled, the offering is defiled too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Your feeling, your thoughts, your deeds, your knowledge and everything of you have impacts on the offering.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On Leviticus, God instructs how you make various offerings on various situation: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;When you offer fine flours as a gift to God (Lev 2): It must be 'fine' flours and it's not easy to grind fine flours especially in the old times. He also has to pour oil on it. And again, it's not easy to extract oil in the old times. If the offerer is with a thankful heart, he will do it with a joy and it won't be a chore to him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And sin offering via animal sacrifices (Lev 4): the sacrificer puts his hands on the animal, and kills the animal by himself. It signifies that even though he should be dead because of his sin, but the animal is killed on behalf of him and his sin. He repents while doing so and it's accepted. If not, it's not an offering but a slaughter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These knowledge are expressed throughout the whole Bible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, the New Testament mentions Abel. Heb 11:4 says, 'By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice.'&#xD;&#xA;And there are all kinds of faith in the same chapter: faith on God's very existence, his goodness, his joy, his love, his righteousness, his faithfulness, his vision, and his power.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may look fuzzy, but it's really about having a personal relationship with God. If you have a healthy relationship with Father or Mother, how you are going to express your thankfulness to them? How about when you feel sorry? How about to your Husband or Wife? With God, you are having a relationship with the original one. God is our original as he created man in his image.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I recently became a father by myself and I thank God for the blessing. Amen." />

In the myth of Iphigenia's sacrifice it was supposed to be in order that Artemis was appeased and winds would be a good tail wind for the fleet that was gathered for the Troy war. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So one reason for sacrifice is to appease the elements personified into gods  by giving up something as precious as a live much valued human.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Iphigenia was replaced by a deer in  a less blood thirsty version. An animal bleeds , and thus it can be a stand in for a human body. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other reasons for offering sacrifices were in order that the fields would prosper, generally for prosperity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Produce is inanimate and does not bleed. So in the Cain and Abel narrative considered as a myth the produce is a poor substitute  for a human, it is not alive. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It probably reflects the values the cultures  set  in order , for  whoever felt the need to sacrifice , *not my life* but, &quot;another human stand in&quot;  (slaves and captured enemies) , &quot;an animal&quot;, &quot;produce&quot; in diminishing importance.

Kramer, however, did give credence to it, as mentioned by the blogger to whom you linked (see Kramer's *History Begins at Sumer,* pp. 143-44). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a long story short, the god Enki out of curiosity eats 8 plants in the paradise of Dilmun (cf. Eve eating the forbidden fruit), which the goddess Ninhursag considers a mortal sin, so she causes 8 body parts (including his rib) of Enki to suffer, and he is on the brink of death. Enlil takes up Enki's cause and persuades Ninhursag to relent, and so various deities then come to heal each of Enki's body parts. The one who heals his rib is the goddess Ninti, whose name means both &quot;lady of the rib,&quot; and &quot;lady who makes live,&quot; which serves as a pun. Thus is established a possible parallel between Ninti and Eve, who was created from Adam's rib (in Hebrew *tesla*) and whose name in Hebrew (*hawwa*) connotes life (thus Eve was called &quot;the mother of all the living&quot; in Genesis 3:20). The pun doesn't work in Hebrew since the words for rib and life differ, but I'm not sure the biblical writer knew about it or, if he did, cared. (Having said that, it looks like the biblical writer made his own pun, because the Hebrew word for rib, *tsela,* can also connote &quot;stumbling,&quot; so although Eve was ostensibly created to be Adam's helper (Gen. 2:18), she proved to be his stumbling block.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are obvious parallels here, which have gotten many people excited, but proving a direct influence has proved elusive, and I know of no biblical scholars (whether faith-based or secular) who maintain that there is any such direct influence, because the usual scholarly criteria for proving intertextual influence are not strongly met here; but this remains a reasonable possibility. More generally, many prevalent ancient Near Eastern mythological motifs do show up in the Hebrew Bible, so it is clear to me that biblical Palestine shared a common cultural (including mythological) context with the broader ancient Near East.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Four immediately come to mind: **Dionysus**, **Inanna**/**Ishtar**, **Aphrodite**, and **Cybele**.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First up is Dionysus, a god best known for wine and drunkenness, but surely you can see how that quickly is connected to other, darker qualities. Already in the earliest text mentioning him, Dionysus is a god of two natures, &quot;joy and sorrow&quot; as Hesiod (or Pseudo-Hesiod) in the *Catalogue of Women* fr. 179 Most (= fr. 87 Evelyn-White, for those with the older Loeb or are looking online) puts it:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;...Dionysus gave to Mmen as a delight and as a burden  &#xD;&#xA;Whoever drinks his fill, the wine becomes maddening for him,  &#xD;&#xA;it binds together his feet and his hands and his tongue and his mind  &#xD;&#xA;with invisible bonds, and soft sleep loves him.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Trans. Glenn Most, Loeb Classical Library)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Clearly Dionysus embodies the very nature of alcohol.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aside from the power which comes from over-intoxication, there were also his attendants, the Maenads (also called the Bacchae or Bacchantes). These women roamed the countryside in drunken, mad revelry. In their frenzy, though, they were also known to kill because of the altered state that received from Dionysus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Two of the most famous of this event were the killing of Orpheus and the killing of Pentheus. Orpheus, the eminent musician of the ancient Greek world, who with his lyre charmed Hades himself into giving him back his wife, in grief after losing his wife again (he was instructed not to turn back to look at her before they left the cave, and yet when he neared the end he could not help himself), was torn apart by Maenads in Thrace.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The death of Pentheus is recounted in Euripides' [*Bacchae*](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0092). There Pentheus the king of Thebes refused the worship of Dionysus, so the god made local women crazy, including Pentheus' own mother, and they tore him to pieces.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ancients made it clear the god himself was part of this hallucinogenic enterprise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;While busily engaged, with sudden beat  &#xD;&#xA;they hear resounding tambourines; and pipes  &#xD;&#xA;and crooked horns and tinkling brass renew,  &#xD;&#xA;unseen, the note; saffron and myrrh dissolve  &#xD;&#xA;in dulcet odours; and, beyond belief,  &#xD;&#xA;the woven webs, dependent on the loom,  &#xD;&#xA;take tints of green, put forth new ivy leaves,  &#xD;&#xA;or change to grape-vines verdant. There the thread  &#xD;&#xA;is twisted into tendrils, there the warp  &#xD;&#xA;is fashioned into many-moving leaves—  &#xD;&#xA;the purple lends its splendour to the grape.  &#xD;&#xA;And now the day is past; it is the hour  &#xD;&#xA;when night ambiguous merges into day,  &#xD;&#xA;which dubious owns nor light nor dun obscure;  &#xD;&#xA;and suddenly the house begins to shake,  &#xD;&#xA;and torches oil-dipped seem to flare around,  &#xD;&#xA;and fires a-glow to shine in every room,  &#xD;&#xA;and phantoms, feigned of savage beasts, to howl.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ovid, *Metamorphoses* 4.391–404, trans. by More 1922&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The next goddesses are **Ishtar** and **Inanna**, with Isthar being the Akkadian equivalent of the Sumerian Inanna, and therefore there is considerable overlap between the two. Nevertheless, despite Ishtar's recognition, Inanna precedes her.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the central myths of **Inanna** is the *Descent of Inanna*. Here Inanna comes to visit her sister Ereshkigal in the Underworld, when her sister has her stripped of her garments (symbolic of her power) and tries to force her to remain there. Inanna was able to escape by offering a substitute, and she ended up choosing her lover (husband?) Dumuzi.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It should be also noted that she utterly leveled Ebih, a mountain which refused to worship her. Yet clearly she's also a sexual goddess. The historical Shulgi, king of Ur, uses terms like &quot;my consort&quot; and &quot;your beloved husband&quot; in describing his relationship with the goddess. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This and other hymns lead some scholars to see her as a powerful goddess, whose personality could be highly erotic but simultaneously utterly destructive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Semitic people of southern Iraq borrowed these myths of Inanna for their goddess **Ishtar**, whom they equated. Not much more can be said about Ishtar and Tammuz (the Akkadian version of Dumuzi) that Gilgamesh, in his famous epic, hadn't already:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Woe to him whom Ishtar had honoured! The fickle goddess treated her passing lovers cruelly, and the unhappy wretches usually paid dearly for the favours heaped on them. Animals, enslaved by love, lost their native vigour: they fell into traps laid by men or were domesticated by them. 'Thou has loved the lion, mighty in strength', says the hero Gilgamesh to Ishtar, 'and thou hast dug for him seven and seven pits! Thou hast loved the steed, proud in battle, and destined him for the halter, the goad and the whip.'&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Listen to me while I tell the tale of your lovers.

You struck and turned him into a wolf; now his own herd-boys chase him away, his own hounds worry his flanks.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Epic of Gilgamesh* Tablet 6, trans. by Sandars 1972&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Reference and further reading:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Gwendolyn Leick 1994. *Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature*. Routledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See in particular chapter 9 (&quot;Inanna Rejoicing in Her Vulva&quot;) and chapter 10 (&quot;'My Consort, Maid Inanna, Lady Voluptuousness of Heaven and Earth'&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next is **Cybele**, originally an Anatolian wilderness/mountain goddess who was later imported to Greece and Rome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This goddess' most famous story seems a neat parallel with Inanna/Ishtar, though it's too speculative to say whether there is a direct connection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ovid in his *Fasti* (a lengthy etiological elegy of the Roman calendar) sums it up nicely:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I said ‘Where did this urge to cut off  &#xD;&#xA;Their members come from?’ As I ended, the Muse spoke:  &#xD;&#xA;‘In the woods, a Phrygian boy, Attis, of handsome face,  &#xD;&#xA;Won the tower-bearing goddess with his chaste passion.  &#xD;&#xA;She desired him to serve her, and protect her temple,  &#xD;&#xA;And said: “Wish, you might be a boy for ever.”  &#xD;&#xA;He promised to be true, and said: “If I’m lying  &#xD;&#xA;May the love I fail in be my last love.”  &#xD;&#xA;He did fail, and in meeting the nymph Sagaritis,  &#xD;&#xA;Abandoned what he was: the goddess, angered, avenged it.  &#xD;&#xA;She destroyed the Naiad, by wounding a tree,  &#xD;&#xA;Since the tree contained the Naiad’s fate.  &#xD;&#xA;Attis was maddened, and thinking his chamber’s roof  &#xD;&#xA;Was falling, fled for the summit of Mount Dindymus.  &#xD;&#xA;Now he cried: “Remove the torches”, now he cried:  &#xD;&#xA;“Take the whips away”: often swearing he saw the Furies.  &#xD;&#xA;He tore at his body too with a sharp stone,  &#xD;&#xA;And dragged his long hair in the filthy dust,  &#xD;&#xA;Shouting: “I deserved this! I pay the due penalty  &#xD;&#xA;In blood! Ah! Let the parts that harmed me, perish!  &#xD;&#xA;Let them perish!” cutting away the burden of his groin,  &#xD;&#xA;And suddenly bereft of every mark of manhood.  &#xD;&#xA;His madness set a precedent, and his unmanly servants  &#xD;&#xA;Toss their hair, and cut off their members as if worthless.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ovid, *Fasti* 4.221-242 (trans. Kline 2004)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly, several ancient authors (e.g. Apollodorus 3.5) state that Cybele taught to Dionysus the *orgia*, the ecstatic and frenzied form of worship in their respective cults. Orpheus, said to have been killed by Bacchantes, as aforementioned the ecstatic and frenzied worshipers of Dionysus, also had orgiastic mysteries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The last of the goddesses I'll mention is **Aphrodite**. The infamous goddess of love is called Venus by the Romans, there is thus a connection to Inanna/Ishtar, who were said to have been represented by the planet Venus (as too was Aphrodite and Venus).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like alcohol, love can be good or bad, and it shows with her. Befitting the goddess of love, she was also said to be the most beautiful goddess. She was married to Hephaestus (= Vulcan), a lame and disfigured god but an excellent craftsman, and already in Homer she is caught by him having an affair with the more handsome Ares (= Mars).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Her destructive power was manifest in different ways. First, as the most beautiful goddess, she won the &quot;beauty contest&quot; (caused by a golden apple thrown at a party on Olympus on which was inscribed &quot;to the most beautiful&quot;) with the Trojan prince Paris (also called Alexander, not at all to be confused with Alexander the Great) judging her, Hera (= Juno, Queen of the Gods, goddess of childbirth), and Athena (= Minvera, a goddess of wisdom, craft, and skill)—the event is now aptly named The Judgment of Paris). Most will know how this story ends: Paris receives as a bribery gift the hand of Helen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus, who thereupon with his brother Agamemnon and &quot;all the Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives&quot; attack Troy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ever since then, &quot;love and war&quot; was a major theme throughout all of Greek and Roman literature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a connection with Inanna/Ishtar, too. First, Aphrodite used to be connected to war more intimately than merely the cause of the Trojan War. Some early depictions of Aphrodite have her suited up for battle. There's also the story inside the *Iliad* in which Aphrodite fights, is wounded by Diomedes, and cries to her mother, the goddess Dione, after which Zeus then chastises her for being out of place in war:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This only drew a smile from the Father of men and gods. Calling golden Aphrodite to his side, he said: &quot;War is not for you, my child, tend to the loving deeds of wedlock, and leave the fighting to Ares the swift and to Athene.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Homer, *Iliad* 428-430, trans. Kline 2009&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole scene is a close parallel to Ishtar who, after Gilgamesh insulted her (referencing Tammuz/Dumizi), flies up to her father Anu, and asks him to release Gugalanna the mighty Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh, though it was then slain by Gilgamesh's companion Enkidu, who himself died because of it).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Homer therefore is likely to be combating the existent idea of Aphrodite as a goddess of *both* love and war. Even if he was fairly successful, her destructive powers were still seen. I always found this vase to be a nice representation of this: http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/K9.1.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To further this connection, Aphrodite also had a lover, whose name was **Adonis**, most certainly connected to the Semitic word *adon*, meaning &quot;lord&quot; (whence Hebrew *adonai* meaning &quot;My Lord&quot;). Pseudo-Apollodorus has the best summary (shorter than Ovid's, whose is the best story, but not a summary):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Because of Aphrodite's wrath** (for she did not honour Aphrodite), Smyrna developed a lust for her father, and with the help of her nurse slept with him for twelve nights without his knowing it. When he found out he drew his sword and started after her, and as he was about to overtake her, she prayed to the gods to become invisible. The gods took pity on her and changed her into the tree called the Smyrna. Nine months later the tree split open and the baby named Adonis was born. Because of his beauty, Aphrodite secreted him away in a chest, keeping it from the gods, and left him with Persephone. But when Persephone got a glimpse of Adonis, she refused to return him. When the matter was brought to Zeus for arbitration, he divided the year into three parts and decreed that Adonis would spent one third of the year by himself, one third with Persephone, and the rest with Aphrodite. But Adonis added his own portion to Aphrodite’s. Later on, while hunting, he was attacked by a boar and died.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apollodorus *Bibliotecha* 3.18 trans. Aldrich 1921&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I highlighted above a nice phrase summarizing this response!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also concerns of the Underworld, similar to Inanna and Dumuzi:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On his death Adonis was obliged to descend into the lower world, but he was allowed to spend six months out of every year with his beloved Aphrodite in the upper world. (Orph. hymn. 55. 10.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Adonis&quot; in *A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology*, ed. by William Smith." />

Routledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See in particular chapter 9 (&quot;Inanna Rejoicing in Her Vulva&quot;) and chapter 10 (&quot;'My Consort, Maid Inanna, Lady Voluptuousness of Heaven and Earth'&quot;).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Cybele&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Next is **Cybele**, originally an Anatolian wilderness/mountain goddess who was later imported to Greece and Rome.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This goddess' most famous story seems a neat parallel with Inanna/Ishtar, though it's too speculative to say whether there is a direct connection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ovid in his *Fasti* (a lengthy etiological elegy of the Roman calendar) sums it up nicely:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I said ‘Where did this urge to cut off  &#xD;&#xA;Their members come from?’ As I ended, the Muse spoke:  &#xD;&#xA;‘In the woods, a Phrygian boy, Attis, of handsome face,  &#xD;&#xA;Won the tower-bearing goddess with his chaste passion.  &#xD;&#xA;She desired him to serve her, and protect her temple,  &#xD;&#xA;And said: “Wish, you might be a boy for ever.”  &#xD;&#xA;He promised to be true, and said: “If I’m lying  &#xD;&#xA;May the love I fail in be my last love.”  &#xD;&#xA;He did fail, and in meeting the nymph Sagaritis,  &#xD;&#xA;Abandoned what he was: the goddess, angered, avenged it.  &#xD;&#xA;She destroyed the Naiad, by wounding a tree,  &#xD;&#xA;Since the tree contained the Naiad’s fate.  &#xD;&#xA;Attis was maddened, and thinking his chamber’s roof  &#xD;&#xA;Was falling, fled for the summit of Mount Dindymus.  &#xD;&#xA;Now he cried: “Remove the torches”, now he cried:  &#xD;&#xA;“Take the whips away”: often swearing he saw the Furies.  &#xD;&#xA;He tore at his body too with a sharp stone,  &#xD;&#xA;And dragged his long hair in the filthy dust,  &#xD;&#xA;Shouting: “I deserved this! I pay the due penalty  &#xD;&#xA;In blood! Ah! Let the parts that harmed me, perish!  &#xD;&#xA;Let them perish!” cutting away the burden of his groin,  &#xD;&#xA;And suddenly bereft of every mark of manhood.  &#xD;&#xA;His madness set a precedent, and his unmanly servants  &#xD;&#xA;Toss their hair, and cut off their members as if worthless.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ovid, *Fasti* 4.221-242 (trans. Kline 2004)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly, several ancient authors (e.g. Apollodorus 3.5) state that Cybele taught to Dionysus the *orgia*, the ecstatic and frenzied form of worship in their respective cults. Orpheus, said to have been killed by Bacchantes, as aforementioned the ecstatic and frenzied worshipers of Dionysus, also had orgiastic mysteries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;##Aphrodite&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The last of the goddesses I'll mention is **Aphrodite**. The infamous goddess of love is called Venus by the Romans, there is thus a connection to Inanna/Ishtar, who were said to have been represented by the planet Venus (as too was Aphrodite and Venus).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like alcohol, love can be good or bad, and it shows with her. Befitting the goddess of love, she was also said to be the most beautiful goddess. She was married to Hephaestus (= Vulcan), a lame and disfigured god but an excellent craftsman, and already in Homer she is caught by him having an affair with the more handsome Ares (= Mars).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Her destructive power was manifest in different ways. First, as the most beautiful goddess, she won the &quot;beauty contest&quot; (caused by a golden apple thrown at a party on Olympus on which was inscribed &quot;to the most beautiful&quot;) with the Trojan prince Paris (also called Alexander, not at all to be confused with Alexander the Great) judging her, Hera (= Juno, Queen of the Gods, goddess of childbirth), and Athena (= Minvera, a goddess of wisdom, craft, and skill)—the event is now aptly named The Judgment of Paris). Most will know how this story ends: Paris receives as a bribery gift the hand of Helen of Sparta, wife to Menelaus, who thereupon with his brother Agamemnon and &quot;all the Achaeans, Danaans, and Argives&quot; attack Troy.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ever since then, &quot;love and war&quot; was a major theme throughout all of Greek and Roman literature.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a connection with Inanna/Ishtar, too. First, Aphrodite used to be connected to war more intimately than merely the cause of the Trojan War. Some early depictions of Aphrodite have her suited up for battle. There's also the story inside the *Iliad* in which Aphrodite fights, is wounded by Diomedes, and cries to her mother, the goddess Dione, after which Zeus then chastises her for being out of place in war:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; This only drew a smile from the Father of men and gods. Calling golden Aphrodite to his side, he said: &quot;War is not for you, my child, tend to the loving deeds of wedlock, and leave the fighting to Ares the swift and to Athene.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Homer, *Iliad* 428-430, trans. Kline 2009&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The whole scene is a close parallel to Ishtar who, after Gilgamesh insulted her (referencing Tammuz/Dumizi), flies up to her father Anu, and asks him to release Gugalanna the mighty Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh, though it was then slain by Gilgamesh's companion Enkidu, who himself died because of it).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Homer therefore is likely to be combating the existent idea of Aphrodite as a goddess of *both* love and war. Even if he was fairly successful, her destructive powers were still seen. I always found this vase to be a nice representation of this: http://www.theoi.com/Gallery/K9.1.html&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To further this connection, Aphrodite also had a lover, whose name was **Adonis**, most certainly connected to the Semitic word *adon*, meaning &quot;lord&quot; (whence Hebrew *adonai* meaning &quot;My Lord&quot;). Pseudo-Apollodorus has the best summary (shorter than Ovid's, whose is the best story, but not a summary):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **Because of Aphrodite's wrath** (for she did not honour Aphrodite), Smyrna developed a lust for her father, and with the help of her nurse slept with him for twelve nights without his knowing it. When he found out he drew his sword and started after her, and as he was about to overtake her, she prayed to the gods to become invisible. The gods took pity on her and changed her into the tree called the Smyrna. Nine months later the tree split open and the baby named Adonis was born. Because of his beauty, Aphrodite secreted him away in a chest, keeping it from the gods, and left him with Persephone. But when Persephone got a glimpse of Adonis, she refused to return him. When the matter was brought to Zeus for arbitration, he divided the year into three parts and decreed that Adonis would spent one third of the year by himself, one third with Persephone, and the rest with Aphrodite. But Adonis added his own portion to Aphrodite’s. Later on, while hunting, he was attacked by a boar and died.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apollodorus *Bibliotecha* 3.18 trans. Aldrich 1921&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I highlighted above a nice phrase summarizing this response!)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is also concerns of the Underworld, similar to Inanna and Dumuzi:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On his death Adonis was obliged to descend into the lower world, but he was allowed to spend six months out of every year with his beloved Aphrodite in the upper world.

While the word &quot;el&quot; is a generic word for a god, it is also the proper name for the head of the Canaanite pantheon, El. His origins are most directly from the Amorite god Amurru, but going further back he shared traits with Anue (An) and Ea (once).

Yahweh, as the Bible itself attests several times (Deut. 33:2-3; Judg. 5:4-5; Hab. 3:3, 7; Ps. 68:8-9; Zech. 9:14), was originally from Seir (or Teman) in the Midian, which spans the east and west sides of the Araba valley in Sinai. Once Yahweh arrived in Palestine from migrants from the Midian (which echoes the stories in Exodus and Numbers), he had to compete for supremacy with the native Canaanite gods. Over time, El was merged into Yahweh, the survivor. Since this merger took place only over time, that's why we see so many references in the Hebrew Bible where Yahweh and El are intended as the same, or more accurately are retroactively explained as being the same. The issue is also confused because the different authors of the Hebrew Bible presenting different positions on this question. Thus, according to one version, the Hebrew god is announced as Yahweh (being the same as the god of Abraham which was El) to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:15, by the Elohist author), which implies that Yahweh was not previously known to the Hebrews. But another author (known as the Yahwist, or J) calls God Yahweh even in the Eden story, and in Genesis 4:26 says that God was known as Yahweh almost from the beginning of humankind. This difference may reflect a situation where the traditional El remained strong in the northern kingdom of Israel, whereas the upstart god Yahweh was being promoted in Judah.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For further reference, this process of merger is discussed well in Mark Smith's book entitled The Early History of God.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a side note, El's wife Asherah was inherited by Yahweh as a result of their merger.

Kramer, however, did give credence to it, as mentioned by the blogger to whom you linked (see Kramer's *History Begins at Sumer,* pp. 143-44). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a long story short, the god Enki out of curiosity eats 8 plants in the paradise of Dilmun (cf. Eve eating the forbidden fruit), which the goddess Ninhursag considers a mortal sin, so she causes 8 of Enki's body parts (including his rib) to suffer, and he is on the brink of death. Enlil takes up Enki's cause and persuades Ninhursag to relent, and so various deities then come to heal each of Enki's body parts. The one who heals his rib is the goddess Ninti, whose name means both &quot;lady of the rib,&quot; and &quot;lady who makes live,&quot; which serves as a pun. Thus is established a possible parallel between Ninti and Eve, who was created from Adam's rib (in Hebrew *tesla*) and whose name in Hebrew (*hawwa*) connotes life (thus Eve was called &quot;the mother of all the living&quot; in Genesis 3:20). The pun doesn't work in Hebrew since the words for rib and life differ, but I'm not sure the biblical writer knew about it or, if he did, cared. (Having said that, it looks like the biblical writer made his own pun, because the Hebrew word for rib, *tsela,* can also connote &quot;stumbling,&quot; so although Eve was ostensibly created to be Adam's helper (Gen. 2:18), she proved to be his stumbling block.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are obvious parallels here, which have gotten many people excited, but proving a direct influence has proved elusive, and I know of no biblical scholars (whether faith-based or secular) who maintain that there is any such direct influence, because the usual scholarly criteria for proving intertextual influence are not strongly met here; but this remains a reasonable possibility. More generally, many prevalent ancient Near Eastern mythological motifs do show up in the Hebrew Bible, so it is clear to me that biblical Palestine shared a common cultural (including mythological) context with the broader ancient Near East.&#xD;&#xA;" />

Of the top of my head, [Perseus][1], [Tristian and Iseult][2], and [Culhwch and Olwen][3] are all examples of this type of story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote from [Roger Loomis' review of Math Vab Mathonwy, An Inquiry into the Origins and Development of the Fourth Branch of the Mabingogi][4] (I didn't want to read the entire book):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The chief discovery is the ultimate dependence of Math upon the Irish myth of Balor and Lug for its main outline (pp.  65-112).  Significant is the fact that this myth, surviving most clearly in folktales taken down in the nineteenth century, must have supplied the framework for a story composed as early as the twelfth century.  It is a variant of the widespread formula of the King and His Prophesied Death (pp.  8, 366),2 of which the Perseus and Oedipus stories furnish familiar examples.  The plot of the famous Irish story may be reconstructed as follows.  Balor, learning of a prophecy that he would be slain by his daughter's son, to be named Lug Lamfada, with a particular spear, on Lug's wedding night, sought to prevent this con- summation.  First he imprisoned his daughter, but a certain Cian gained access to her, and she bore a son.  Balor then tried to have his grandson drowned, but in vain.  When he learned of his failure, he put successively three geasa on the boy: never to receive a name except from himself, never to bear arms, and never to wed earthly wife (pp.  102-106).  But Lug circumvented all these barriers and finally fulfilled his destiny by slaying Balor in the manner prescribed.  Now the Welsh tale is remarkable in that it preserves practically every essential feature of this outline in the right order, but every feature has been recast several times, and all the original cohesion and rationale has been lost.  Math is at pains to preserve the virginity of a damsel, but no reason is offered and the damsel is not his daughter.  The damsel is ravished by stratagem, but nothing is said of her son.  Instead, the woman who takes her place gives birth to a son, Dylan, and he promptly goes to the sea and, instead of drowning, swims like a fish.  But it is not he who becomes the hero of the story but one who develops from the caul or placenta which Dylan's mother lets fall at the time of his birth.  This caul develops into a second child, and upon him are sworn successively the three geasa that were sworn upon Lug: but it is his mother who swears them, and she obviously has no motive.  The way in which she is induced to name him Lleu Llaw Gyffes is obviously reminiscent of the way in which Balor was induced to name his grandson Lug Lamfada.  **Finally, it is not Lleu's grandfather who is slain by a special spear, but Lleu's rival, Gronwy**.  Except that the order remains intact, the elements could hardly have been juggled more drastically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A common feature in these types of stories is that the father-figure is very difficult to kill. Here's an example from Culhwch and Olwen, a story from the same tradition as Math. (The story of Balor and Lug, upon which Math is based upon, also includes a father figure who is hard to kill).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And the third day they returned to the palace. And Yspaddaden Penkawr said to them, &quot;Shoot not at me again unless you desire death. Where are my attendants? Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-law.&quot; Then they arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilhwch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his head. &quot;A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly! As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water; and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged. Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.&quot; And they went to meat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Lleu takes the role of the father figure in this rearranged story, it also makes sense that he is hard to kill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# An attempted explanation of the symbolism behind Lleu's position:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to know that Lleu seems to be associated with the sun. According to [Queen of the Night: Rediscovering the Celtic Moon Goddess][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Mabinogi, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Bright One of the Skillful Hand) is transformed into an eagle, residing for a period of time in the top of an oak tree. The eagle and the oak are symbols of a solar or celestial deity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found an article that [claims that the position that Lleu can be killed corresponds to something related to astronomy] (the hut to the sky, the tub/well to the milky way, the goat represents Capella, and Lleu to the constellation Perseus [Perseus seems to have a foot in the milkyway]). The article seems legit, and is definitely worth considering, but I worry that it doesn't seem to be verified by any academics. Here's a picture of the constellation Perseus (from [AstroPixels.com][7]):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![The constellation Perseus](http://astropixels.com/constellations/charts/images/Per_map.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another explanation (found in an article about Shakespeare!) ties the age of the spear to the creation of a new year (and perhaps to rebirth):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Blodeuwedd and her lover planned to slay her husband, the Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes; but he could only be killed by a spear forged &quot;in a year of Sundays&quot;; and so Lleu was struck down exactly one year after the plan was conceived. The death of the year equated the death of the husband; either event signals or is signaled by the Queen's or Lady's attachment to another man.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Aguirre, Manuel. [Life, Crown, and Queen: Gertrude and the Theme of Sovereignty][8].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as a bonus, here's an article that elaborates on the connection between names, transformations, and the difference between Lleu's and Blodeuwedd's metamorphoses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The metamorphoses of Lleu and Blodeu(w)edd confirm the theory that, in the Fourth Branch, names function to secure both body and identity. The scene in which Lleu spontaneously transforms into an eagle and the earlier scene in which he is named are linked in such a way that his name emerges as a crucial guarantee of human embodiment; by contrast, Blodeu(w)edd is renamed so that her metamorphosis can never be undone.  Having persuaded her husband, Lleu, to reveal how he may be killed, Blodeu(w)edd has Gronw ambush Lleu while he is demonstrating to his wife exactly the point at which he is at his most vulnerable. Gronw’s ambush prompts Lleu’s transformation: “Then Gronw rose up from the hill that is called Brynn Cyfergyr, and he got up on the end of one knee, and cast the poison-spear, and hit [Lleu] in the side, so that the spear shaft leapt from him and the head stayed in him. And then he went flying up in the shape of an eagle, and gave a terrible cry” (Williams 1951, 88). Although the text gives more details about the spear thrust than the metamorphosis, Lleu’s transformation clearly results from the entry of the spearhead into his body. This passage mirrors the episode in which the young Lleu is named. In this scene, disguised, Gwydion brings the boy to visit Aranrhod; when Aranrhod sees the boy hit a wren with surprising precision and comments on his dexterity, saying, “it is with a skilful hand Lleu can be killed only by a single blow from a spear made only during Sunday mass over the course of one year, and he must be neither inside nor outside, neither on horseback nor on foot; the inventive solution to this riddle involves Lleu’s standing with one foot on the edge of a roofed outdoor bathtub, the other on the back of a goat. The actions in both scenes are also described by identical verbs, bwrw (to throw, cast) and medru (to strike). Sheehan that the fair one hit it [ Ys llaw gyffes y medrwys y lleu ef ]” (Williams 1951, 80), Gwydion manipulates her comment to provide a name for his nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Fair-haired One of the Skilful Hand). Lleu’s name is also the key to his metamorphosis’s reversal. When Gwydion finds the eagle perched in a treetop, he sings three englynion , each time naming Lleu, until the eagle descends from the tree and alights on Gwydion’s knee; Gwydion is then able to strike him with the hutlath “so that he was in his own shape [ rith ]” (Williams 1951, 90). Lleu’s metamorphosis is consistent with those examined above, in that the narrator does not refer to Lleu by name until he is again in his own, human body. Lleu cannot regain his body until he regains his name: it is Gwydion’s ritualized poetic naming of his nephew together with a tap of the hutlath that restores Lleu to human form. Gronw’s skillful striking of Lleu causes Lleu to lose both name and form by reversing the subject positions (active/passive, striker/struck) of the scenario whereby he gained his name&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Sheehan, Sarah, [Matrilineal Subjects: Ambiguity, Bodies, and Metamorphosis in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi][9])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus&#xD;&#xA;[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult&#xD;&#xA;[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culhwch_and_Olwen&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2847153&#xD;&#xA;[5]: https://books.google.com/books?id=1l1yXq4xGHsC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=lleu+llaw+gyffes+eagle+symbolism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JFo9N9d_Hh&amp;sig=ejmr1zvfmO7oQcar6g4KWDbQjcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xmKVcmTGsn2ggSS9IGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lleu%20llaw%20gyffes%20eagle%20symbolism&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html&#xD;&#xA;[7]: http://astropixels.com/&#xD;&#xA;[8]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/518100&#xD;&#xA;[9]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/591089" />

Unfortunately, the in-text citations do not work, I can find no other mention of either of these that does not quote Wikipedia verbatim, and this probably doesn't count as mythology, either. Neither are associated with &quot;myths&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I stumbled across [this](http://www.theallineed.com/entertainment/08033180.htm) blog post/whatever-it-is. Either way, it was helpful insofar as it led me somewhere. Citing *Sumerian Mythology*, 1944, 1961, by; Samuel Noah Kramer, it states&#xD;&#xA;&gt; KUR&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Sumeria 3rd Millennium B.C.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;Since the dragon-slaying theme was an important motif in the Sumerian mythology of the third millennium B. C., it is not unreasonable to assume that many a thread in the texture of the Greek and early Christian dragon tales winds back to Sumerian sources.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We find mention of Kur in three myths from the 4th - 3rd Millennium B.C., (more than a millennium before Tiamat!), In the introductory prologue to the epic tale &quot;Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World,&quot;( written on eight tablets - seven excavated in Nippur and one in Ur), Where Enki, the water-god, fights Kur after he learns that The goddess Ereshkigal was carried off violently into the nether world, by Kur. Enki fought Kur from a boat, and Kur fought back savagely with stones of all sizes, and attacked Enki's boat with the primeval waters which it controlled. Unfortunately for us, the author of this tale is so anxious to proceed with the Gilgamesh tale that he doesn't finish the dragon part, and leaves us hanging. It is certain that Enki wins though because he is in the rest of the poem, Kur is not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The second version of the slaying-of-the-dragon myth can be found in &quot;The Feats and Exploits of Ninurta.&quot; (49 tablets) A significant version, due to the fact that it is evident that it was utilized by the Semitic redactors in the creation of the Babylonian Creation Myth featuring Tiamat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In this version, Ninurta, the warrior-god, is the hero of the story. His personified weapon, Sharur, kisses up to him in a drawn out speech extolling the heroic qualities and deeds of Ninurta to convince him to go after Kur, and attach and destroy him. What Sharur has against Kur is not written in the text that is available. Ninurta leaves to do as asked, but finds himself lacking and &quot;flees like a bird&quot;. Sharur though, won't let it go and speaks, reassuring and encouraging Ninurta with his words. &quot;Ninurta now attacks Kur fiercely with all the weapons at his command, and Kur is completely destroyed.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The third version of the slaying-of-the-dragon myth can be found in &quot;Inanna and Ebih.&quot; A one hundred and ninety line poem. (12 tablets)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The dragon-slayer in this version of the story is a goddess, Inanna, curiously known as both the goddess of love and also as the goddess of battle and strife, (She must have been married), and is also referred to in many Sumerian hymns as &quot;The Destroyer of Kur.&quot; Kur, is also referred to as The 'mountain,' in the Poem. Did I mention that Kur was also the first fire breathing dragon?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interesting. I decided to learn more.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, the relevant part of *Sumerian Mythology* appears to be available [here](http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum08.htm). No part of it quotes any relevant sections of the myths that imply or outright state that Kur is a dragon. So I decided to find them for myself. (By the way, related notes on many Sumerian myths, including these, can be found [here](http://www.ianlawton.com/mes4.htm)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World**](http://templeofsumer.org/myth14.html)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The relevant passage appears to be&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1 It began in the early days of the world, after the earth and the heavens had been separated. It was a turbulent time. Ereshkigal had been taken by the dragon Kur and Enki was sailing after to put things into the order that they belonged in.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2 The waters that Enki sailed were being pummeled by rocks. The smallest of these hit the side of Enki's boat like they were like hammers. The largest of these hit with the impact of a boulder thrown from a catapult.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is all that remains of the explicit tale of the fight of Kur against Enki.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**The Exploits of Ninurta**](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr162.htm)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Asag leapt up at the head of the battle. For a club it uprooted the sky, took it in its hand; like a snake it slid its head along the ground. It was a mad dog attacking to kill the helpless, dripping with sweat on its flanks. Like a wall collapsing, the Asag fell on Ninurta the son of Enlil. Like an accursed storm, it howled in a raucous voice; like a gigantic snake, it roared at the Land. It dried up the waters of the Mountains, dragged away the tamarisks, tore the flesh of the Earth and covered her with painful wounds. It set fire to the reed-beds, bathed the sky in blood, turned it inside out; it dispersed the people there. At that moment, on that day, the fields became black potash, across the whole extent of the horizon, reddish like purple dye -- truly it was so!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Asag](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asag) is often considered to be different from [Kur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kur). However, [this](http://www.blackdrago.com/fame/kur.htm) (of dubious reputation) states&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are Asag and Kur synonymous, both referencing a dragon? Or are they different entities attributed as the dark force overcome by Ninurta? Owing to the age of Sumerian literature, and its predecessors adapting the myths, this remains uncertain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[**Inana and Eibh**](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/section1/tr132.htm)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; An, the king of the deities, answered her: &quot;My little one demands the destruction of this mountain -- what is she taking on? Inana demands the destruction of this mountain -- what is she taking on? She demands the destruction of this mountain -- what is she taking on?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &quot;It has poured fearsome terror on the abodes of the gods. It has spread fear among the holy dwellings of the Anuna deities. It has poured its terror and ferocity over this land. It has poured the mountain range's radiance and fear over all the lands. Its arrogance extends grandly to the centre of heaven.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; My lady confronted the mountain range. She advanced step by step. She sharpened both edges of her dagger. She grabbed Ebih's neck as if ripping up esparto grass. She pressed the dagger's teeth into its interior. She roared like thunder.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The rocks forming the body of Ebih clattered down its flanks. From its sides and crevices great serpents spat venom. She damned its forests and cursed its trees. She killed its oak trees with drought. She poured fire on its flanks and made its smoke dense. The goddess established authority over the mountain. Holy Inana did as she wished.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Huh. That's disappointing. The literal interpretation states that Inana's foe is a mountain, not a dragon. Indeed, as [that earlier dubious source](http://www.blackdrago.com/fame/kur.htm) states,&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Another disambiguation should be made between Kur the dragon and the myth of Inanna and Ebih. Inanna was the Sumerian goddess of love, battle, and strife and among her many epithets was the 'destroyer of Kur.' In this myth, Kur is also called 'mountain Ebih,' which is a district northeast of Sumer. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Therefore, Inanna overcame Kur, but in this myth, Kur is an hostile land, not a dragon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is the myth being metaphorical when it describes Inana's foe as a mountain?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This myth is doubtful, as are, come to think of it, the other two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In my (non-expert) opinion, *Gilgamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World* is not strong evidence for a dragon. The source I gave is the only translation I could find that explicitly calls Kur a dragon. Most others do not refer to that. *Inana and Eibh* also seems to be a lost cause, because, quite literally, Inana is fighting a mountain, not a dragon. I doubt that the myth is being figurative. Mythology tends to be literal, realistic or not.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*The Exploits of Ninurta* seems to be the best evidence available. It says&#xD;&#xA;&gt; like a snake it slid its head along the ground.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; like a gigantic snake, it roared at the Land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; . . .&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It set fire to the reed-beds&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Circumstantial? Perhaps. But it seems like a dragon-like creature. I'm calling this one the winner.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now for the date. Embarrassingly enough, I haven't found any date for this other than the one Kramer gave, somewhere in the 4th or 3rd millennium B.C." />

I don't think the stories ever specified whether the sacrifice took place in heaven (I personally doubt that detail would have been relevant to the people telling the story), but the Aztecs had highly developed concepts of heaven and hell. If you're interested in learning more, the book [*Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind*][1] features an extensive analysis of that myth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The [tag:popol-vuh] includes a story of how two twins die and are resurrected in the land of the dead (i.e. hell, not heaven).

When he got there, he saw the condor rising up in the distance. As he ran to meet him, the condor flew to his side, and he saw that the sacred condor had grown old. And the condor could see that the boy, too, had grown old and wrinkled.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found this story in John Bierhorst's book [*Black Rainbow: Legends of the Incas and Myths of Ancient Peru*][2] (also the source of the above quotations).

This interpretation serves to eliminate what otherwise would be evidence from Paul of Christ's being on earth and therefore existing, such as his having disciples and teaching people, having brothers, being crucified by the Romans, etc. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This idea falls way outside the range of the discussion of Paul's Christology among mainstream New Testament and Pauline scholars that I'm aware of, meaning that they never discuss this possibility. Since these Christ-myth theorists are presenting this new interpretation of Paul as being based on a myth, I'm wondering whether there is any precedent in other myths of a god being sacrificed and then resurrected entirely in heaven (as opposed to on earth or in the underworld, as in the usual dying-and-rising god myths). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Is anyone aware of any such precedents? By this I mean myths that could have influenced such alleged appearance of such a Christ myth, which probably means myths from the ancient Near East, Egypt, or the Mediterranean, rather than from further away. I can't think of any. If there are none, an answer to that effect would be appreciated." />

It should be noted that even the Hebrew scriptures, probably the only ones I can think of that has a date of creation so closely tied to generations of men, is not really precise, for a generation is not a precise number.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, some ancient Greeks did try to come up with dates for certain mythological events, particularly the Trojan War. Herodotus said that it was 800 years before him (= ca. 1250 BCE), and connects it chronologically to Heracles, Dionysus, and Egyptian mythology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Among the Greeks, Heracles, Dionysus, and Pan are held to be the youngest of the gods. But in Egypt, Pan is the most ancient of these and is one of the eight gods who are said to be the earliest of all; Heracles belongs to the second dynasty (that of the so-called twelve gods); and Dionysus to the third, which came after the twelve.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Herodotus, _Histories_ 2.145.1](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D1)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These are Egyptian gods here, rather than Greek ones. Their equivalents are as follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;* Dionysus = Osiris&#xD;&#xA;* Heracles = Khonsu (?)&#xD;&#xA;* Pan = Min&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How many years there were between Heracles and the reign of Amasis, I have already shown; Pan is said to be earlier still; the years between Dionysus and Amasis are the fewest, and they are reckoned by the Egyptians at fifteen thousand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Hdt., _Histories_ 2.145.2](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D2)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here he is referring to his earlier chronology, all Egyptian still, which I'll discuss after this passage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now the Dionysus who was called the son of Semele, daughter of Cadmus, was about sixteen hundred years before my time, and Heracles son of Alcmene about nine hundred years; and Pan the son of Penelope (for according to the Greeks Penelope and Hermes were the parents of Pan) was about eight hundred years before me, and thus of a later date than the Trojan war.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Hdt., _Histories_ 2.145.4](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126%3Abook%3D2%3Achapter%3D145%3Asection%3D4)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We know he has shifted back to Greek chronology by not only reversing the chronology of the Egyptians (and reversal is a very Herodotean thing to do; see Hartog's book at the botton), but listing the Greek parentage. Since Herodotus' life was roughly 480s to after 420, I'll round to roughly 450 for his &quot;time&quot;. That gives us 2050 BCE for the god Dionysus (though this would conflict with Euripides!), 1350 for the life of the hero Heracles, and 1250 for the god Pan, which puts the Trojan war roughly around 1300-1275 or so. This is pretty consistent, as Heracles sacked Troy before Agamemnon, and after doing so put child Priam on the throne. Priam, of course, was an old man during the Trojan War (Apollod. 2.6.4, 3.12.3).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now, the passage Herodotus mentioned above I reproduce below (and can be found at [2.43](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.43&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126)):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Concerning Heracles, I heard it said that he was one of the twelve gods.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Side note: The Egyptians had different pantheons depending on what city you were in. There were either a set of eight (the Ogdoad of Hermopolis: Nu and Naunet, Amun and Amaunet, Kuk and Kauket, Huh and Hauhet), set of nine (the Ennead of Heliopolis: Atum, his children Shu and Tefnut, their children Geb and Nut and their children Osiris, Isis, Set, and Nephthys), nine plus one (centered in Memphis, based on the Ennead but with Ptah as the head), or a set of twelve, of which I do not think we know very well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But nowhere in Egypt could I hear anything about the other Heracles, whom the Greeks know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another side note, this Heracles is actually the Phoenician god Melqart. See Bonnet below if you know French and have access to a scholarly library, or Google Melqart and you can probably find some good information. Or ask another question here!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But Heracles is a very ancient god in Egypt; as the Egyptians themselves say, the change of the eight gods to the twelve, one of whom they acknowledge Heracles to be, was made seventeen thousand years before the reign of Amasis.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Amasis here is Ahmose II, who was Pharaoh 570–526 BCE, placing Heracles in Egypt to ca. 2250 (rounding to a nice middle number), which would make it in the middle of the 6th Dynasty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Herodotus, of course, was not the only historian to work out dates for various mythical events, and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War#Dates_of_the_Trojan_War) has a nice list of various Late Classical/Hellenistic scholars' dates for determining when the Trojan War happened:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Ephorus gives 1135 BC, Sosibius 1172 BC, Eratosthenes 1184 BC/1183 BC, Timaeus 1193 BC, the Parian marble 1209 BC/1208 BC, Dicaearchus 1212 BC, Herodotus around 1250 BC, Eretes 1291 BC, while Douris 1334 BC.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is one further clue about the &quot;origin&quot; of the Greek world, but it is even more imprecise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;Hecataeus the historian was once at Thebes , where he made a genealogy for himself that had him descended from a god in the sixteenth generation. But the priests of Zeus did with him as they also did with me (who had not traced my own lineage). They brought me into the great inner court of the temple and showed me wooden figures there which they counted to the total they had already given, for every high priest sets up a statue of himself there during his lifetime; pointing to these and counting, the priests showed me that each succeeded his father; they went through the whole line of figures, back to the earliest from that of the man who had most recently died. Thus, when Hecataeus had traced his descent and claimed that his sixteenth forefather was a god, the priests too traced a line of descent according to the method of their counting; for they would not be persuaded by him that a man could be descended from a god; they traced descent through the whole line of three hundred and forty-five figures, not connecting it with any ancestral god or hero, but declaring each figure to be a “Piromis” the son of a “Piromis”; in Greek, one who is in all respects a good man.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Herodotus, _Histories_ 2.143](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+2.143&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0126)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hecataeus was Herodotus' real predecessor. He wrote genealogies of the world, including Greek myths, and it's a shame we do not have it anymore, otherwise we might know a bit better when he thought the world began.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Anyway, this passage clues is in on two things. One, Hecataeus places humankind sixteen generations back. This is difficult to reckon, because we do not know how many years he was counting as a generation, but by a normal 40 years, it leads us to 1140 (from 500, when Hecataeus was already a grown man, so perhaps even earlier). This is unlikely to be exactly the case, as he must have placed the Trojan War around this time, as Herodotus did. An alternative would be that he merely placed his line back that far, assuming that the gods were still reproducing with mortals, and Herodotus (and this unnamed Egyptian) must just be mistaken in his assumption that that's when the gods were mating *in the beginning*.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The other thing it lets us know is that the Greeks could imagine that humans were around 10800–14250 BCE (i.e. 10,350 to 13,800 years before *their* time).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That must have been pretty outrageous to the poets!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bonnet, C. 1988. _Melqart.

Kramer, however, did give credence to it, as mentioned by the blogger to whom you linked (see Kramer's *History Begins at Sumer,* pp. 143-44). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To make a long story short, the god Enki out of curiosity eats 8 plants in the paradise of Dilmun (cf. Eve eating the forbidden fruit), which the goddess Ninhursag considers a mortal sin, so she causes 8 of Enki's body parts (including his rib) to suffer, and he is on the brink of death. Enlil takes up Enki's cause and persuades Ninhursag to relent, and so various deities then come to heal each of Enki's body parts. The one who heals his rib is the goddess Ninti, whose name means both &quot;lady of the rib,&quot; and &quot;lady who makes live,&quot; which serves as a pun. Thus is established a possible parallel between Ninti and Eve, who was created from Adam's rib (in Hebrew *tesla*) and whose name in Hebrew (*hawwa*) connotes life (thus Eve was called &quot;the mother of all the living&quot; in Genesis 3:20). The pun doesn't work in Hebrew since the words for rib and life differ, but I'm not sure the biblical writer knew about it or, if he did, cared. (Having said that, it looks like the biblical writer made his own pun, because the Hebrew word for rib, *tsela,* can also connote &quot;stumbling,&quot; so although Eve was ostensibly created to be Adam's helper (Gen. 2:18), she proved to be his stumbling block.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are obvious parallels here, which have gotten many people excited, but proving a direct influence has proved elusive, and I know of no biblical scholars (whether faith-based or secular) who maintain that there is any such direct influence, because the usual scholarly criteria for proving intertextual influence are not strongly met here; but this remains a reasonable possibility. More generally, many prevalent ancient Near Eastern mythological motifs do show up in the Hebrew Bible, so it is clear to me that biblical Palestine shared a common cultural (including mythological) context with the broader ancient Near East.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Arthur George&#xD;&#xA;www.mythologymatters.wordpress.com&#xD;&#xA;" />

While the word &quot;el&quot; is a generic word for a god, it is also the proper name for the head of the Canaanite pantheon, El. His origins are most directly from the Amorite god Amurru, but going further back he shared traits with Anue (An) and Ea (Enki). In Ugarit he was viewed as the creator god and, with his wife Asherah, fathered the other Canaanite gods and goddesses that we see, for example, in the Ugaritic myths including the Keret myth that you mention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The answer to your question whether this is the same god as El in the Bible gets more complicated. The Canaanite El was originally the chief god in Palestine, where Israel later emerged. Yahweh, as the Bible itself attests several times (Deut. 33:2-3; Judg. 5:4-5; Hab. 3:3, 7; Ps. 68:8-9; Zech. 9:14), was originally from Seir (or Teman) in the Midian, which spans the east and west sides of the Araba valley in Sinai. Once Yahweh arrived in Palestine from migrants from the Midian (which echoes the stories in Exodus and Numbers), he had to compete for supremacy with the native Canaanite gods. Over time, El was merged into Yahweh, the survivor. Since this merger took place only over time, that's why we see so many references in the Hebrew Bible where Yahweh and El are intended as the same, or more accurately are retroactively explained as being the same. The issue is also confused because the different authors of the Hebrew Bible presenting different positions on this question. Thus, according to one version, the Hebrew god is announced as Yahweh (being the same as the god of Abraham which was El) to Moses at the burning bush (Exodus 3:15, by the Elohist author), which implies that Yahweh was not previously known to the Hebrews. But another author (known as the Yahwist, or J) calls God Yahweh even in the Eden story, and in Genesis 4:26 says that God was known as Yahweh almost from the beginning of humankind. This difference may reflect a situation where the traditional El remained strong in the northern kingdom of Israel, whereas the upstart god Yahweh was being promoted in Judah.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For further reference, this process of merger is discussed well in Mark Smith's book entitled The Early History of God.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a side note, El's wife Asherah was inherited by Yahweh as a result of their merger. That too became a big issue for proponents of official Temple religion as time went on, as they tried to eliminate her.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Arthur George&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;www.mythologymatters.wordpress.com&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Her power was either nullified or greatly diminished when looked at in reflection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also don't think the eyes were crucial. I'm not aware of any source that stresses her eyes. Rather, they focus on her whole face (Ovid, *Metamorphosis* 4:783) or overall appearance, as in the passage from Apollodoris that you quote. We can't ignore her protruding tongue, tusks, or snakes for hair, since they are all essential to her character and mythological meaning. That's why they are there. And that's why Perseus had to look at the shield even though she was sleeping (presumably her eyes were closed).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we go into the underlying psychological aspects of the myth (as we should with most myths), Perseus, like the typical hero, is in the process of fully realizing his ego consciousness, while this monster represents the all-consuming Terrible Mother of the unconscious seeking to suck him back into there and destroy his nascent ego consciousness. To confront her directly is too dangerous, so only averting the gaze or looking at her indirectly through the reflection will enable him to succeed. In the versions where the &quot;bronze&quot; shield/mirror appears, that is a solar/light symbol of the ego that not only enables him to see a diminished Medusa, but as which as such also serves as a guide and beacon to him to keep him on course. Here it is also relevant that the Greeks also stressed the details of his escape. When Perseus kills the Medusa, the winged horse Perseus appears out of her (representing the ego that has escaped her, a parallel with Perseus himself), which Perseus rides while being pursued by Medusa's sisters. His winged sandals, invisibility helmet, and hiding-wallet also play a figurative role, for which he has to thank Athena, goddess of wisdom (and so of consciousness). See Edward Edinger, *The Eternal Drama: The Inner Meaning of Greek Mythology,* pp. 4, 83; Erich Neumann, *The Great Mother,* p. 166; Erich Neumann, *The Origins and History of Consciousness,* pp. 87, 178, 214-16.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Arthur George&#xD;&#xA;www.mythologymatters.wordpress.com  " />

There is no writing, inscription, artwork, statuary, or anything that indicates Horus (or Osiris) was crucified.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is death and resurrection in Horus' story, though. The Metternich Stele relates the story of Horus dying by the sting of a scorpion. Budge has a nice summary:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;http://www.sacred-texts.com/egy/leg/leg11.htm&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Now soon after Isis had restored to life the son of the woman who had shown churlishness to her, a terrible calamity fell upon her, for her beloved son Horus was stung by a scorpion and died. The news of this event was conveyed to her by the gods, who cried out to her to come to see her son Horus, whom the terrible scorpion Uhat had killed. Isis, stabbed with pain at the news, as if a knife had been driven into her body, ran out distraught with grief. It seems that she had gone to perform a religious ceremony in honour of Osiris in a temple near Hetep-hemt, leaving her child carefully concealed in Sekhet-An. During her absence the scorpion Uhat, which had been sent by Set, forced its way into the biding-place of Horus, and there stung him to death. When Isis came and found the dead body, she burst forth in lamentations, the sound of which brought all the people from the neighbouring districts to her side.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A little bit later: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then he came to Isis and told her that no harm could possibly have happened to Horus, for he was under the protection of the Boat of Ra; but his words failed to comfort Isis, and though she acknowledged the greatness of his designs, she complained that they savoured of delay. &quot;What is the good,&quot; she asks, &quot;of all thy spells, and incantations, and magical formulae, and the great command of maa-kheru, if Horus is to perish by the poison of a scorpion, and to lie here in the arms of Death? Evil, evil is his destiny, for it hath entailed the deepest misery for him and death.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In answer to these words Thoth, turning to Isis and Nephthys, bade them to fear not, and to have no anxiety about Horus, &quot;For,&quot; said he, &quot;I have come from heaven to heal the child for his mother.&quot; He then pointed out that Horus was under protection as the Dweller in his Disk (Aten), the Great Dwarf, the Mighty Ram, the Great Hawk, the Holy Beetle, the Hidden Body, the Divine Bennu, etc., and proceeded to utter the great spell which restored Horus to life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thinking of Horus as a prefiguration of Jesus Christ is a clear-cut case of [parallelomania](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sbl-site.org%2Fassets%2Fpdfs%2Fpresidentialaddresses%2FJBL81_1_1Sandmel1961.pdf&amp;ei=OiuSVZSpM4na-QGc36uYDA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGryVzi_dnulla8QCrdTwahuEXf1w&amp;sig2=2PNWTsY81EwboxzU4iN62A&amp;bvm=bv.96783405,d.cWw) (warning: PDF). Unfortunately, with &quot;researchers&quot; like Acharya S., sometimes the faint parallels (death and revival) become the overarching theme, hiding away any (especially major!)  differences, and twists the rest of the narrative to fit. For example, this was not related to any divine soul-saving god, but rather to ancient Egyptian (religiously-based) medical practices.

One way was to negate the earlier myth. I gave one example in a [previous thread](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/598/was-there-a-significant-transformation-of-the-heracles-mythos-from-homeric-times/970#970). In Pindar's _Olympians_ ode 1, he references the fact that others before him have a version of a myth that is incompatible with his beliefs, namely that Tantalus would kill his son Pelops and feed him to the gods. Instead he creates a story of jealous neighbors who propagate the false myth; really, Pelops was just on Olympus with Poseidon all along!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another way to do it is to just ignore the discrepancy, because the discrepancy is not the main point. Hesiod's _Works and Days_ has a good example of this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;First, he includes a self-correction:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Hesiod, _Works and Days_, 11](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D11)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [_Theogony_ 225](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D207), Hesiod originally listed the goddess Strife (Eris in Greek), who was born of Night (Nyx). Because the point of the _Works and Days_ is different from Theogony, in that he wants to promote the labor of men and hard work, he invents another Strife to use for didactic purposes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But the real inconsistency lies further in. In [_Works and Days_ 42-104](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D42), Hesiod narrates the fall of man through the story of Pandora. After Prometheus stole fire from Olympus and gave it to men, Zeus, angry that men might not now work as hard, devised a plan to give them woman. He made the first woman, Pandora, gave her intense curiosity, and then gave her to Epimetheus, the brother of Prometheus. He then gave Epimetheus a box (nowadays called a jar) filled with various evils. Her curiosity got the better of her, and she opening the box let out all the evils to plague mankind, making it worse than before.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, he thinks that maybe his story didn't quite get across:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So is there no way to escape the will of Zeus. Or if you will, I will sum you up another tale well and skilfully—and do you lay it up in your heart,—how the gods and mortal men sprang from one source.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Hesiod, _Works and Days_ 109](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D83)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now ([109-179](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0132%3Acard%3D109)) Hesiod narrates the &quot;races of men,&quot; in which mortals are created by the gods in several different metals: gold first, and blessed are they; then silver, but they were full of hubris; then bronze, but they were too bloodthirsty; then the &quot;Age of Heroes&quot;, i.e. the Trojan and Theban material; lastly the iron age, which is the current age, and was made degenerate. There is no Pandora, there is no Promethean fire, and that doesn't seem to bother him much. Perhaps these might be closer to parables, but Greek writers believed in them in earnest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Later authors, especially late ones, tended to accept some and expect variation among reports. [Diodorus Siculus](http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/4B*.html) is a good example of this one. When discussing the famous [Calydonian Boar hunt](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/627/are-there-any-ancient-myths-about-adventuring-parties/940#940), he first gives a brief overview of the accepted &quot;facts&quot;:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The facts are these: Once when Oeneus had an excellent crop of grain, he offered sacrifices to the other gods, but neglected Artemis alone; and angered at him for this the goddess sent forth against him the famous Calydonian boar, a creature of enormous size. 3 This animal harried the neighbouring land and damaged the farms; whereupon Meleager, the son of Oeneus, being then in the bloom of youth and excelling in strength and in courage, took along with himself many of the bravest men and set out to hunt the beast. Meleager was the first to plunge his javelin into it and by general agreement was accorded the reward of valour, which consisted of the skin of the animal. 4 But Atalantê, the daughter of Schoeneus, participated in the hunt, and since Meleager was enamoured of her, he relinquished in her favour the skin and the praise for the greatest bravery. The sons of Thestius, however, who had also joined in the hunt, were angered at what he had done, since he had honoured a stranger woman above them and set kinship aside. Consequently, setting at naught the award which Meleager had made, they lay in wait for Atalantê, and falling upon her as she returned to Arcadia took from her the skin. 5 Meleager, however, was deeply incensed both because of the love which he bore Atalantê and because of the dishonour shown her, and espoused the cause of Atalantê. And first of all he urged the robbers to return to the woman the meed of valour which he had given her; and when they paid no heed to him he slew them, although they were brothers of Althaea. Consequently Althaea, overcome with anguish at the slaying of the men of her own blood, uttered a curse in which she demanded the death of Meleager; and the immortals, so the account runs, gave heed to her and made an end of his life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He then _immediately_ follows it up with an account given by &quot;certain writers of myth&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; But certain writers of myths give the following account: — At the time of the birth of Meleager the Fates stood over Althaea in her sleep and said to her that her son Meleager would die at the moment when the brand in the fire had been consumed. Consequently, when she had given birth, she believed that the safety of her child depended upon the preservation of the brand and so she guarded the brand with every care. 7 Afterward, however, being deeply incensed at the murder of her brothers, she burned the brand and so made herself the cause of the death of Meleager; but as time went on she grieved more and more over what she had done and finally made an end of her life by hanging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And that's just it! It doesn't seem to bother Diodorus at all, and it likely didn't bother very many Greeks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In a similar way, the accounts of Electra in Aeschylus' _Oresteia_, Sophocles' _Electra_, and both Euripides' _Electra_ and his _Orestes_ all differ greatly from each other, depending on what they want to emphasize. This was not only acceptable, but encouraged, as sticking too close to someone else's interpretation was considered bad-form, as some comedians were accused of doing; check out Scott McGill's Plagiarism in Latin Literature (2012) [pp. 130-131](https://books.google.com/books?id=B8AxNv5CTdEC&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) (earlier pages are unfortunately hidden for Google Books, but the discussion goes on a bit before and after if you want to find a real copy) for an early Roman accusation against Plautus and Terence.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0130%3Acard%3D207" />

We can also turn to the iconography, which likewise also does not necessarily portray a shield. See, e.g., the metope from Salinas ca. 540 B.C. (at the Museo Nazionale Archeologico in Palermo, Italy; in Morford &amp; Lenardon's *Classical Mythology* 8th ed., p. 552) and the black-figure jug by Amasis, Attic, 6th cen. BCE (in Neumann, *Consciousness* (below), illustration 25) both showing Perseus killing her while simply averting his gaze. For the Greeks, averting the gaze and looking at her reflection in the shield/mirror were obviously equivalent. Her power was either nullified or greatly diminished when looked at in reflection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also don't think the eyes were crucial. I'm not aware of any source that stresses her eyes. Rather, they focus on her whole face (Ovid, *Metamorphosis* 4:783) or overall appearance, as in the passage from Apollodoris that you quote. We can't ignore her protruding tongue, tusks, or snakes for hair, since they are all essential to her character and mythological meaning. That's why they are there. And that's why Perseus had to look at the shield even though she was sleeping (presumably her eyes were closed).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we go into the underlying psychological aspects of the myth (as we should with most myths), Perseus, like the typical hero, is in the process of fully realizing his ego consciousness, while this monster represents the all-consuming Terrible Mother of the unconscious seeking to suck him back into there and destroy his nascent ego consciousness. To confront her directly is too dangerous, so only averting the gaze or looking at her indirectly through the reflection will enable him to succeed. In the versions where the &quot;bronze&quot; shield/mirror appears, that is a solar/light symbol of the ego that not only enables him to see a diminished Medusa, but as which as such also serves as a guide and beacon to him to keep him on course. Here it is also relevant that the Greeks also stressed the details of his escape. When Perseus kills the Medusa, the winged horse Perseus appears out of her (representing the ego that has escaped her, a parallel with Perseus himself), which Perseus rides while being pursued by Medusa's sisters. His winged sandals, invisibility helmet, and hiding-wallet also play a figurative role, for which he has to thank Athena, goddess of wisdom (and so of consciousness). See Edward Edinger, *The Eternal Drama: The Inner Meaning of Greek Mythology,* pp. 4, 83; Erich Neumann, *The Great Mother,* p. 166; Erich Neumann, *The Origins and History of Consciousness,* pp. 87, 178, 214-16.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

See Nora Scott, &quot;The Metternich Stela,&quot; The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 9.8:201-17 (1951) (Horus is &quot;unconscious&quot; (p. 213); Scott was Research Fellow in the Egyptian Art Department at the Met); John Nunn, Ancient Egyptian Medicine, p. 110 (1996) (Horus is &quot;unconscious&quot;); Robert Ritner, *The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice,* p. 57 n. 266 (1993) (Horus is &quot;injured&quot;);  Geraldine Pinch, *Magic in Ancient Egypt,* pp. 144-45 (1994) (Horus is &quot;too weak and ill to suckle&quot; and has a &quot;sickness&quot;); Emily Teeter, *Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt,* p. 175 (2011) (Horus was was &quot;cured&quot; by Thoth, which does not seem like a raising from the dead). This interpretation makes sense in terms of the magical spells recited that invoked this myth to cure victims of snakebite, scorpion stings, etc., who are still alive; they are not being brought back from the dead. For this purpose, the recovery of Horus was being used as a parallel example, so it made sense that he too was only on the brink of death. It is like the Billy Crystal scene in *The Princess Bride,* where his character Miracle Max observes that Wesley is &quot;only mostly dead,&quot; and then proceeds to bring him back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to put it bluntly, the idea is a load of Horuss**t." />

I still haven't a satisfactory explanation from a reputable source, although I'm sure one exists, so this answer is incomplete. However, I think I've answered most of the original question, and I've taken a stab at the symbolism question. If anyone has any additional research, please let me know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Why Lleu is so difficult to kill?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This story is a *heavily modified* version of the &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; archetype, in that there exists a king or ruler or giant who will die when their daughter is married. The ruler attempts to prevent his daughter from being married, but of course she eventually circumvents the ruler and get's married anyway, at which point the ruler dies. This story relates to death but also to rebirth; although the ruler dies, because the daughter marries the ruler's legacy continues, and the husband or son of the daughter replaces the ruler in the mortal world. (A slightly different version also exists: a prophesy says the ruler will die if he has a son, the ruler attempts to not have a son, he has a son anyway, and the son kills his father and takes his father's place.) Of the top of my head, [Perseus][1], [Tristian and Iseult][2], and [Culhwch and Olwen][3] are all examples of this type of story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote from [Roger Loomis' review of Math Vab Mathonwy, An Inquiry into the Origins and Development of the Fourth Branch of the Mabingogi][4] (I didn't want to read the entire book):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The chief discovery is the ultimate dependence of Math upon the Irish myth of Balor and Lug for its main outline (pp.  65-112).  Significant is the fact that this myth, surviving most clearly in folktales taken down in the nineteenth century, must have supplied the framework for a story composed as early as the twelfth century.  It is a variant of the widespread formula of the King and His Prophesied Death (pp.  8, 366),2 of which the Perseus and Oedipus stories furnish familiar examples.  The plot of the famous Irish story may be reconstructed as follows.  Balor, learning of a prophecy that he would be slain by his daughter's son, to be named Lug Lamfada, with a particular spear, on Lug's wedding night, sought to prevent this con- summation.  First he imprisoned his daughter, but a certain Cian gained access to her, and she bore a son.  Balor then tried to have his grandson drowned, but in vain.  When he learned of his failure, he put successively three geasa on the boy: never to receive a name except from himself, never to bear arms, and never to wed earthly wife (pp.  102-106).  But Lug circumvented all these barriers and finally fulfilled his destiny by slaying Balor in the manner prescribed.  Now the Welsh tale is remarkable in that it preserves practically every essential feature of this outline in the right order, but every feature has been recast several times, and all the original cohesion and rationale has been lost.  Math is at pains to preserve the virginity of a damsel, but no reason is offered and the damsel is not his daughter.  The damsel is ravished by stratagem, but nothing is said of her son.  Instead, the woman who takes her place gives birth to a son, Dylan, and he promptly goes to the sea and, instead of drowning, swims like a fish.  But it is not he who becomes the hero of the story but one who develops from the caul or placenta which Dylan's mother lets fall at the time of his birth.  This caul develops into a second child, and upon him are sworn successively the three geasa that were sworn upon Lug: but it is his mother who swears them, and she obviously has no motive.  The way in which she is induced to name him Lleu Llaw Gyffes is obviously reminiscent of the way in which Balor was induced to name his grandson Lug Lamfada.  **Finally, it is not Lleu's grandfather who is slain by a special spear, but Lleu's rival, Gronwy**.  Except that the order remains intact, the elements could hardly have been juggled more drastically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A common feature in these types of stories is that the father-figure is very difficult to kill. Here's an example from Culhwch and Olwen, a story from the same tradition as Math. (The story of Balor and Lug, upon which Math is based upon, also includes a father figure who is hard to kill).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And the third day they returned to the palace. And Yspaddaden Penkawr said to them, &quot;Shoot not at me again unless you desire death. Where are my attendants? Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-law.&quot; Then they arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilhwch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his head. &quot;A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly! As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water; and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged. Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.&quot; And they went to meat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Lleu takes the role of the father figure in this rearranged story, it also makes sense that he is hard to kill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# An attempted explanation of the symbolism behind Lleu's position:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to know that Lleu seems to be associated with the sun. According to [Queen of the Night: Rediscovering the Celtic Moon Goddess][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Mabinogi, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Bright One of the Skillful Hand) is transformed into an eagle, residing for a period of time in the top of an oak tree. The eagle and the oak are symbols of a solar or celestial deity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found an article that [claims that the position that Lleu can be killed corresponds to something related to astronomy][100] (the hut to the sky, the tub/well to the milky way, the goat represents Capella, and Lleu to the constellation Perseus [Perseus seems to have a foot in the milkyway]). The article seems legit, and is definitely worth considering, but I worry that it doesn't seem to be verified by any academics. Here's a picture of the constellation Perseus (from [AstroPixels.com][7]):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![The constellation Perseus](http://astropixels.com/constellations/charts/images/Per_map.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another explanation (found in an article about Shakespeare!) ties the age of the spear to the creation of a new year (and perhaps to rebirth):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Blodeuwedd and her lover planned to slay her husband, the Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes; but he could only be killed by a spear forged &quot;in a year of Sundays&quot;; and so Lleu was struck down exactly one year after the plan was conceived. The death of the year equated the death of the husband; either event signals or is signaled by the Queen's or Lady's attachment to another man.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Aguirre, Manuel. [Life, Crown, and Queen: Gertrude and the Theme of Sovereignty][8].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as a bonus, here's an article that elaborates on the connection between names, transformations, and the difference between Lleu's and Blodeuwedd's metamorphoses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The metamorphoses of Lleu and Blodeu(w)edd confirm the theory that, in the Fourth Branch, names function to secure both body and identity. The scene in which Lleu spontaneously transforms into an eagle and the earlier scene in which he is named are linked in such a way that his name emerges as a crucial guarantee of human embodiment; by contrast, Blodeu(w)edd is renamed so that her metamorphosis can never be undone.  Having persuaded her husband, Lleu, to reveal how he may be killed, Blodeu(w)edd has Gronw ambush Lleu while he is demonstrating to his wife exactly the point at which he is at his most vulnerable. Gronw’s ambush prompts Lleu’s transformation: “Then Gronw rose up from the hill that is called Brynn Cyfergyr, and he got up on the end of one knee, and cast the poison-spear, and hit [Lleu] in the side, so that the spear shaft leapt from him and the head stayed in him. And then he went flying up in the shape of an eagle, and gave a terrible cry” (Williams 1951, 88). Although the text gives more details about the spear thrust than the metamorphosis, Lleu’s transformation clearly results from the entry of the spearhead into his body. This passage mirrors the episode in which the young Lleu is named. In this scene, disguised, Gwydion brings the boy to visit Aranrhod; when Aranrhod sees the boy hit a wren with surprising precision and comments on his dexterity, saying, “it is with a skilful hand Lleu can be killed only by a single blow from a spear made only during Sunday mass over the course of one year, and he must be neither inside nor outside, neither on horseback nor on foot; the inventive solution to this riddle involves Lleu’s standing with one foot on the edge of a roofed outdoor bathtub, the other on the back of a goat. The actions in both scenes are also described by identical verbs, bwrw (to throw, cast) and medru (to strike). Sheehan that the fair one hit it [ Ys llaw gyffes y medrwys y lleu ef ]” (Williams 1951, 80), Gwydion manipulates her comment to provide a name for his nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Fair-haired One of the Skilful Hand). Lleu’s name is also the key to his metamorphosis’s reversal. When Gwydion finds the eagle perched in a treetop, he sings three englynion , each time naming Lleu, until the eagle descends from the tree and alights on Gwydion’s knee; Gwydion is then able to strike him with the hutlath “so that he was in his own shape [ rith ]” (Williams 1951, 90). Lleu’s metamorphosis is consistent with those examined above, in that the narrator does not refer to Lleu by name until he is again in his own, human body. Lleu cannot regain his body until he regains his name: it is Gwydion’s ritualized poetic naming of his nephew together with a tap of the hutlath that restores Lleu to human form. Gronw’s skillful striking of Lleu causes Lleu to lose both name and form by reversing the subject positions (active/passive, striker/struck) of the scenario whereby he gained his name&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Sheehan, Sarah, [Matrilineal Subjects: Ambiguity, Bodies, and Metamorphosis in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi][9])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus&#xD;&#xA;[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult&#xD;&#xA;[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culhwch_and_Olwen&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2847153&#xD;&#xA;[5]: https://books.google.com/books?id=1l1yXq4xGHsC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=lleu+llaw+gyffes+eagle+symbolism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JFo9N9d_Hh&amp;sig=ejmr1zvfmO7oQcar6g4KWDbQjcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xmKVcmTGsn2ggSS9IGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lleu%20llaw%20gyffes%20eagle%20symbolism&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html&#xD;&#xA;[7]: http://astropixels.com/&#xD;&#xA;[8]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/518100&#xD;&#xA;[9]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/591089&#xD;&#xA;[100]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html" />

As Anna V. noted, he likely represents the sun. Besides the flaming wheel in the sky, a cult title of Apollo is Ixios, apparently from the city of Ixiae, but perhaps also related to Ixion here. However, Apollo and Helios (i.e. the sun) were not originally the same deity, and so the connection there is intriguing but uncertain. Moreover, the name defies attempts at etymology, although the [LSJ suggests](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=%CE%99%CE%BE%CE%AF%CF%89%CE%BD&amp;la=greek#lexicon) a possibility with ἱκέτης (_hiketēs_), meaning &quot;suppliant.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Other ideas for Ixion put forth are related to clouds. Since Ixion laid with a cloud thinking it was Hera, some, such as Martin Nilsson, have speculated that instead of a sun, he was some figure for making it rain. Nilsson also points out that this cloud was connected with Nephele (which is merely Greek for &quot;cloud&quot;) in the Argonaut story, where she saves Phrixus and Helle by sending them a ram with golden fleece.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ixion also must be of extreme antiquity and likely connected to Märchen, as he is completely divorced from any of the major lineages.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are parallels for him, though. Besides &quot;the sun&quot; or &quot;rain clouds&quot;, he is one of the major offenders against the order of Zeus' universe, such as Sisyphus, Tantalus, Asclepius, Atlas, Prometheus, and later Iapetus' two other sons Menoetius and Epimetheus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sisyphus might be the closest parallel to Ixion, as one who rolls a rock up the hill and lets it fall back down parallels the rising and fall of the sun, but other interpretations are possible, such as the waves, the tides, the moon even. His sin was to hold death hostage so that no one could die.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Tantalus' crime I outlined [here](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/598/was-there-a-significant-transformation-of-the-heracles-mythos-from-homeric-times/970#970). I do not know what the pool of water below and fruit trees above him mean. It is interesting to note that Pindar thinks his crime was stealing ambrosia (and thus attempting immortality), which parallels not only Sisyphus' crime above, but also Asclepius', who with his medicine could raise the dead. Asclepius wasn't punished in Hades, but outright zapped by lightning ([Pindar, *Pythian* 3](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0162%3Abook%3DP.%3Apoem%3D3)).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Their crime however probably reflect Pindar's preoccupation with the hubris of his clientele. After winning fame and glory (kleos is the key word here) in athletic games, they might have developed a big head, and Pindar, suggests Crotty, Kurke, and Nicholson, might have added a tender caution in his praise.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Atlas and Prometheus are both tied in some way to mountains (Prometheus literally), with Atlas at the western edge of the world (the Atlas Mountains in Morocco) and Prometheus in the eastern edge (the Caucasus Mountains).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hesiod picked up on this and schematized it, making Atlas, Prometheus, Epimetheus, and Menoetius (though a titan, the name is human, and is shared with Patroclus' father in the _Iliad_, e.g. [16.14](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0133%3Abook%3D16%3Acard%3D1)), all of which committed some injustice against Zeus which characterizes human condition. Menoetius was full of hubris, and thus Zeus struck him with a thunderbolt. Epimetheus (&quot;afterthought&quot;, based on his brother Prometheus, &quot;forethought&quot;) of course received Pandora, the first woman and the one who unleashed evils on humankind.

The sun as a  wheel is an ancient symbol, often depicted in the form of a wheeled chariot being driven across the sky; the swastika is another version of the sun-wheel in motion. In this ritual, the wheel was stuffed with straw or hay (the yellowish color of which resembled the sun) so that the wheel itself was barely visible, and in many cases an axle protruded a meter or so on each side, which people used to guide it down the hill. The idea was for it to roll all the way to the bottom, into the water if any; if it did not roll all the way down, the harvest would be bad&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![flaming wheel][6]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the lower amphora image, on the right , there is an extension and it looks as if the &quot;nymph&quot;? is sitting on it, and it does look like the axle in the third picture. (On the summer solstice there exists still a pagan ritual with fire in Greece. Fires are lit in the evening  of the 24th of June and the people jump through it. It happened in the neighborhoods of Athens when I was growing up).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A possibility exists that the rolling wheel ending up  in the water was a ritual in the area ,  as described above, and Ixion was tied up to the wheel in the myth on a preexisting symbol  so that he would burn as a punishment. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Epitome:book=E:chapter=1&amp;highlight=ixion&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://books.google.gr/books?id=gUZo7Qz6H5AC&amp;pg=PA1072&amp;lpg=PA1072&amp;dq=Ixion%20and%20A.B.Cook&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4p1Q1M1S2A&amp;sig=oqsa73TaxPNkbovlKmLEw4vJpx8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QwuWVbbeHYX7UsuFkZAO&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ixion%20and%20A.B.Cook&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/mX77y.png&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/l9sdw.png&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://mythologymatters.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/summer-solstice-mythology-midsummer-night/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/1tb0M.jpg" />

In this connection, Kerenyi in his *The Gods of the Greeks* (pp. 159-60) penned a conclusory statement, &quot;One can easily recognise in the whole story the punishment of an older, savage sun-god who had to had to be tamed beneath the rule of Zeus.&quot; This might be the case since Zeus was in the business of absorbing other deities and their functions, but Kerenyi points to no sources or other grounds for this conclusion. The article that Anna quotes in her answer above, which relies on Cook's *Zeus,* takes the same view. There is indeed significant iconography showing the wheel to be flaming (just search on Google for Ixion images), so this image appears to have been popular. On the other hand, Robert Graves (*Greek Myths,* 63.1-2) goes off in another direction showing echoes of Frazer, claiming that Ixion was an oak-king who married a moon-goddess (Dia), and was then slain in a ritual involving him being spread-eagled on a tree, which was later made into a wheel. He also claims that old kings called themselves Zeus and their marriage to the moon-goddess displeased the later Olympian priests, hence the hubris theme leading to the punishment. Graves also links Ixion's name to vegetation, not anything solar. So no solar motif for Graves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Turning to the actual sources, from what I see they don't seem to be stressing a solar theme. Although the *Scholiast* on Pindar's Pythians mentions that the wheel was fiery, Pindar himself (Pythian Ode 2.39-44), as well as Hyginus (*Fabulae* 62), Diodorus (*Historical Library* 4.69.5), Apollodorus (*Library,* Epit. 1.20), Virgil (*Georgics* 4.484; *Aeneid* 6.601), and Lucian (*Dialogues of the Gods* VI) never mention fire, and they just mention the wheel spinning/whirling, not necessarily going across the sky (although that could be the case), and that the wheel turns due to the force of the winds (not its own power, as sun-gods do). To my mind, this, plus the fact that some later sources (Hyginus; Virgil, *Aeneid*; Lucian) felt comfortable placing the wheel in Hades rather than in the sky suggests that a solar symbolism of the wheel is not the main point here, at least as the story appears in these later stories which differ from the versions that Kerenyi and Cook were talking about. Thus, but Kerenyi and Cook could be right and we may just be seeing later versions that mask the original, apples vs. oranges to some extent.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Based on what we do have for sources, for these authors the wheel and its spinning appear to symbolize primarily the passage of time into eternity, showing that Ixion's punishment is for eternity. Most of the sources (Pindar, Diodorus, Hyginus, and Lucian) stress that the wheel is supposed to turn for eternity. This has a rough parallel in the Punishment of Prometheus for his act of hubris, which likewise was supposed to be eternal. Finally, Pindar mentions that the wheel has 4 spokes, which normally symbolizes dividing the passage of time measures (seasons), which are endless cycles. That is, the hub, which appears not to move, represents eternity, while the outer part with the spokes moving represents time passing. See, e.g., *The Book of Symbols,* A.

None of the accounts has him being broken or otherwise physically abused while on the wheel; except, of course, for the eternal flames in any versions of the story which have fire on the wheel, but that is very different from being broken on the wheel.

I won't duplicate here what I said in my post (since it is all relevant here) and will simply incorporate that here for background on the goddess as part of this answer, so that I can focus here on the narrow question asked, i.e., whether Liberty and Columbia are the same goddess. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But first regarding the threshold issue of whether we are dealing with myth here: If we were merely dealing with Columbia Pictures and its symbol, then I can see why there would not be real myth. But there is a long historical background to this showing that we are dealing with the evolution of classical Greek and Roman goddesses (Eleutheria and Libertas respectively).

Columbia, on the other hand, represented America itself more than just its ideals, was usually dressed in the stars and stripes, and was invoked for popular patriotic and political purposes (see image below).

(Even at the time, much of the information came from questionnaires that he sent out (e.g., to missionaries), rather than from proper anthropological reports, and so was of questionable reliability.) As a result, scholars today generally don't rely on him in making conclusions. Nevertheless, his work is still a valuable, stimulating resource, especially when one is formulating one's own theories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is also important to understand Frazer because he influenced so many others who write about myth (e.g., Jane Harrison, Robert Graves), so it is important to be able to detect Frazer's influence when reading their writings. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Before reading even some of Frazer, however, it is important to learn about his background and theories, and their legacy, in order to be able to interpret what he is saying. Unfortunately, in the abridged edition that you are talking about (assuming it is the same Touchstone 1996 edition that I have) there is no introduction by another scholar that could serve this purpose. So the best resource for this purpose is *J.G. Frazer: His Life and Work* by Robert Ackerman; if you can afford it, Ackerman's other book, *The Myth and Ritual School: J.G. Frazer and the Cambridge Ritualists* is also good in this regard.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As far as whether it is worth reading the whole abridged version (much less the whole 3rd unabridged edition of 12 volumes + vol 13 supplement), this of course would be best if you have the time to do it. In my own case, I did not read it from cover to cover, but consult it (including the full unabridged version) regularly as needed, and over the years I have read probably two-thirds of it by sections, not in order. I don't think I've suffered much from not reading it in order cover-to-cover, but finishing the rest is certainly on my bucket list.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

I still haven't a satisfactory explanation from a reputable source, although I'm sure one exists, so this answer is incomplete. However, I think I've answered most of the original question, and I've taken a stab at the symbolism question. If anyone has any additional research, please let me know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Why Lleu is so difficult to kill?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This story is a *heavily modified* version of the &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; archetype, in that there exists a king or ruler or giant who will die when their daughter is married. The ruler attempts to prevent his daughter from being married, but of course she eventually circumvents the ruler and get's married anyway, at which point the ruler dies. This story relates to death but also to rebirth; although the ruler dies, because the daughter marries the ruler's legacy continues, and the husband or son of the daughter replaces the ruler in the mortal world. (A slightly different version also exists: a prophesy says the ruler will die if he has a son, the ruler attempts to not have a son, he has a son anyway, and the son kills his father and takes his father's place.) Of the top of my head, [Perseus][1], [Tristian and Iseult][2], and [Culhwch and Olwen][3] are all examples of this type of story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote from [Roger Loomis' review of Math Vab Mathonwy, An Inquiry into the Origins and Development of the Fourth Branch of the Mabingogi][4] (I didn't want to read the entire book):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The chief discovery is the ultimate dependence of Math upon the Irish myth of Balor and Lug for its main outline (pp.  65-112).  Significant is the fact that this myth, surviving most clearly in folktales taken down in the nineteenth century, must have supplied the framework for a story composed as early as the twelfth century.  It is a variant of the widespread formula of the King and His Prophesied Death (pp.  8, 366), of which the Perseus and Oedipus stories furnish familiar examples.  The plot of the famous Irish story may be reconstructed as follows...  Now the Welsh tale is remarkable in that it preserves practically every essential feature of this outline in the right order, but every feature has been recast several times, and all the original cohesion and rationale has been lost.  Math is at pains to preserve the virginity of a damsel, but no reason is offered and the damsel is not his daughter.  The damsel is ravished by stratagem, but nothing is said of her son.  Instead, the woman who takes her place gives birth to a son, Dylan, and he promptly goes to the sea and, instead of drowning, swims like a fish.  But it is not he who becomes the hero of the story but one who develops from the caul or placenta which Dylan's mother lets fall at the time of his birth.  This caul develops into a second child, and upon him are sworn successively the three geasa that were sworn upon Lug: but it is his mother who swears them, and she obviously has no motive.  The way in which she is induced to name him Lleu Llaw Gyffes is obviously reminiscent of the way in which Balor was induced to name his grandson Lug Lamfada.  **Finally, it is not Lleu's grandfather who is slain by a special spear, but Lleu's rival, Gronwy**.  Except that the order remains intact, the elements could hardly have been juggled more drastically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A common feature in these types of stories is that the father-figure is very difficult to kill. Here's an example from Culhwch and Olwen, a story from the same tradition as Math. (The story of Balor and Lug, upon which Math is based upon, also includes a father figure who is hard to kill).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And the third day they returned to the palace. And Yspaddaden Penkawr said to them, &quot;Shoot not at me again unless you desire death. Where are my attendants? Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-law.&quot; Then they arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilhwch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his head. &quot;A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly! As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water; and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged. Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.&quot; And they went to meat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Lleu takes the role of the father figure in this rearranged story, it also makes sense that he is hard to kill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# An attempted explanation of the symbolism behind Lleu's position:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to know that Lleu seems to be associated with the sun. According to [Queen of the Night: Rediscovering the Celtic Moon Goddess][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Mabinogi, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Bright One of the Skillful Hand) is transformed into an eagle, residing for a period of time in the top of an oak tree. The eagle and the oak are symbols of a solar or celestial deity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found an article that [claims that the position that Lleu can be killed corresponds to something related to astronomy][100] (the hut to the sky, the tub/well to the milky way, the goat represents Capella, and Lleu to the constellation Perseus [Perseus seems to have a foot in the milkyway]). The article seems legit, and is definitely worth considering, but I worry that it doesn't seem to be verified by any academics. Here's a picture of the constellation Perseus (from [AstroPixels.com][7]):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![The constellation Perseus](http://astropixels.com/constellations/charts/images/Per_map.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another explanation (found in an article about Shakespeare!) ties the age of the spear to the creation of a new year (and perhaps to rebirth):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Blodeuwedd and her lover planned to slay her husband, the Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes; but he could only be killed by a spear forged &quot;in a year of Sundays&quot;; and so Lleu was struck down exactly one year after the plan was conceived. The death of the year equated the death of the husband; either event signals or is signaled by the Queen's or Lady's attachment to another man.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Aguirre, Manuel. [Life, Crown, and Queen: Gertrude and the Theme of Sovereignty][8].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as a bonus, here's an article that elaborates on the connection between names, transformations, and the difference between Lleu's and Blodeuwedd's metamorphoses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The metamorphoses of Lleu and Blodeu(w)edd confirm the theory that, in the Fourth Branch, names function to secure both body and identity. The scene in which Lleu spontaneously transforms into an eagle and the earlier scene in which he is named are linked in such a way that his name emerges as a crucial guarantee of human embodiment; by contrast, Blodeu(w)edd is renamed so that her metamorphosis can never be undone.  Having persuaded her husband, Lleu, to reveal how he may be killed, Blodeu(w)edd has Gronw ambush Lleu while he is demonstrating to his wife exactly the point at which he is at his most vulnerable. Gronw’s ambush prompts Lleu’s transformation: “Then Gronw rose up from the hill that is called Brynn Cyfergyr, and he got up on the end of one knee, and cast the poison-spear, and hit [Lleu] in the side, so that the spear shaft leapt from him and the head stayed in him. And then he went flying up in the shape of an eagle, and gave a terrible cry” (Williams 1951, 88). Although the text gives more details about the spear thrust than the metamorphosis, Lleu’s transformation clearly results from the entry of the spearhead into his body. This passage mirrors the episode in which the young Lleu is named. In this scene, disguised, Gwydion brings the boy to visit Aranrhod; when Aranrhod sees the boy hit a wren with surprising precision and comments on his dexterity, saying, “it is with a skilful hand Lleu can be killed only by a single blow from a spear made only during Sunday mass over the course of one year, and he must be neither inside nor outside, neither on horseback nor on foot; the inventive solution to this riddle involves Lleu’s standing with one foot on the edge of a roofed outdoor bathtub, the other on the back of a goat. The actions in both scenes are also described by identical verbs, bwrw (to throw, cast) and medru (to strike). Sheehan that the fair one hit it [ Ys llaw gyffes y medrwys y lleu ef ]” (Williams 1951, 80), Gwydion manipulates her comment to provide a name for his nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Fair-haired One of the Skilful Hand). Lleu’s name is also the key to his metamorphosis’s reversal. When Gwydion finds the eagle perched in a treetop, he sings three englynion , each time naming Lleu, until the eagle descends from the tree and alights on Gwydion’s knee; Gwydion is then able to strike him with the hutlath “so that he was in his own shape [ rith ]” (Williams 1951, 90). Lleu’s metamorphosis is consistent with those examined above, in that the narrator does not refer to Lleu by name until he is again in his own, human body. Lleu cannot regain his body until he regains his name: it is Gwydion’s ritualized poetic naming of his nephew together with a tap of the hutlath that restores Lleu to human form. Gronw’s skillful striking of Lleu causes Lleu to lose both name and form by reversing the subject positions (active/passive, striker/struck) of the scenario whereby he gained his name&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Sheehan, Sarah, [Matrilineal Subjects: Ambiguity, Bodies, and Metamorphosis in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi][9])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus&#xD;&#xA;[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult&#xD;&#xA;[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culhwch_and_Olwen&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2847153&#xD;&#xA;[5]: https://books.google.com/books?id=1l1yXq4xGHsC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=lleu+llaw+gyffes+eagle+symbolism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JFo9N9d_Hh&amp;sig=ejmr1zvfmO7oQcar6g4KWDbQjcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xmKVcmTGsn2ggSS9IGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lleu%20llaw%20gyffes%20eagle%20symbolism&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html&#xD;&#xA;[7]: http://astropixels.com/&#xD;&#xA;[8]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/518100&#xD;&#xA;[9]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/591089&#xD;&#xA;[100]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html" />

However, the basic theme of traditional Chinese folklore does feature an emperor in heaven who is essentially a mirror of the emperor on Earth. The depiction of the Jade Emperor in *Journey to the West* matches much of this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**1. Slackers are punished severely.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We see this in, for example, the tragic love story of the [Weaver and the Cowherd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weaver_Girl_and_the_Cowherd). An ancient version of this story, [recorded in around 6th century](http://ctext.org/wiki.pl?if=en&amp;res=983262), says:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 天河之東有織女，天帝之子也。年年機杼勞役，織成雲錦天衣，容貌不暇整。帝憐其獨處，許嫁河西牽牛郎，嫁後遂廢機杼。天帝怒，責另歸東西，但使一年一度相會&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; On the east bank of the Celestial River, there is a weaver. She is the child of the Celestial Emperor. Year after year she toiled to weave celestial garments, looking busy and disheveled. The Emperor felt sorry for her loneliness, so he married her to the Cowherd from the west bank of the river. She stopped weaving after the wedding. The Emperor was enraged, and punished them by making them return to east and west separately. But he had them meet once per year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here we see the Celestial Emperor reacting to her daughter &lt;s&gt;going on honeymoon&lt;/s&gt; slacking off with inhumane harshness. This is despite the marriage being his own idea and all her previous years of hard work. I would also argue this demonstrates inflexibility and a quickness to anger on the Emperor's part, just as you saw in the novel's version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**2. The powers of the Jade Emperor is purely authority**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Jade Emperor is essentially the administrator of the heavenly court. Just as the Chinese would not expect the temporal emperor to personally arrest vandalising teenagers, the Jade Emperor metes out punishment and rewards not by doing any work himself, but by exercising his authority as the ruler of heaven.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An example is the story of Lightening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Once upon a time, Thunder worked alone, striking down people who were wasteful from the clouds. Back then, an impoverished but [pious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filial_piety) woman struggles to provide her mother-in-law with the best. To save on costs, the woman serves the mother white rice, then retreats to the kitchen to eat only [bran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran) herself. The mother however suspected the pious woman of keeping the good food for herself.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; So one day, she barged in to see for herself what the daughter has been eating. Discovering that the daughter-in-law has been eating bran, the mother was heartbroken. She told the daughter to dump the bran and come eat the good rice with her. Unfortunately, it was  a stormy night and Thunder was patrolling. Upon seeing the pious daughter throwing the bran away, he struck her down, thinking she was wasting perfectly good food.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When the Celestial Court heard of this miscarriage of justice, the Emperor was filled with great sympathy. To reward the daughter for her piety, he ennobled her in heaven as Lady Lightening. To prevent another tragedy like hers from happening, Lightening accompanies Thunder out on patrols, and illuminates the earth before the thunder strikes.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; That's why thunders are always preceded by lightening.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are many variations to this story, but the ending is essentially identical: *the Jade Emperor gives a victim &quot;justice&quot; by using his authority as administrator of the Celestial Court* to give her a job in Heaven. Not to raise her from the dead, or give her family a fortune, or do anything for her really other than issuing a decree.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**3. The Jade Emperor is short-tempered.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Chinese have two ancient sayings regarding rulers: `伴君如伴虎`, literally, *accompanying the ruler is like keeping a tiger company*. Chinese Emperors were notorious for being ill-tempered with little regard for just about anyone else. Since social interactions in the Celestial Realm were imagined based on realities, the Jade Emperor seems to have inherited such traits.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An illustration of these traits in folklore [is the legend](http://ortho.clmed.ncku.edu.tw/~cjlin/news/8901/890112.htm) that the Immortal Poet [Li Bai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Bai) was the [Great White Golden Star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taibai_Jinxing) in heaven.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Great White Golden Star works as an alchemist in heaven. Being an alcoholic, he got drunk one day and accidentally knocked over an alchemy pot. The Jade Emperor was enraged, and stripped him of his godhood, sending him to be reborn on earth as the poet Li Bai.&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; " />

Gronw’s skillful striking of Lleu causes Lleu to lose both name and form by reversing the subject positions (active/passive, striker/struck) of the scenario whereby he gained his name&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Sheehan, Sarah, [Matrilineal Subjects: Ambiguity, Bodies, and Metamorphosis in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi][9])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus&#xD;&#xA;[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult&#xD;&#xA;[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culhwch_and_Olwen&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2847153&#xD;&#xA;[5]: https://books.google.com/books?id=1l1yXq4xGHsC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=lleu+llaw+gyffes+eagle+symbolism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JFo9N9d_Hh&amp;sig=ejmr1zvfmO7oQcar6g4KWDbQjcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xmKVcmTGsn2ggSS9IGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lleu%20llaw%20gyffes%20eagle%20symbolism&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html&#xD;&#xA;[7]: http://astropixels.com/&#xD;&#xA;[8]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/518100&#xD;&#xA;[9]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/591089&#xD;&#xA;[100]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html" />

I still haven't a satisfactory explanation from a reputable source, although I'm sure one exists, so this answer is incomplete. However, I think I've answered most of the original question, and I've taken a stab at the symbolism question. If anyone has any additional research, please let me know.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Why Lleu is so difficult to kill?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This story is a *heavily modified* version of the &quot;Tristan and Iseult&quot; archetype, in that there exists a king or ruler or giant who will die when their daughter is married. The ruler attempts to prevent his daughter from being married, but of course she eventually circumvents the ruler and get's married anyway, at which point the ruler dies. This story relates to death but also to rebirth; although the ruler dies, because the daughter marries the ruler's legacy continues, and the husband or son of the daughter replaces the ruler in the mortal world. (A slightly different version also exists: a prophesy says the ruler will die if he has a son, the ruler attempts to not have a son, he has a son anyway, and the son kills his father and takes his father's place.) Of the top of my head, [Perseus][1], [Tristian and Iseult][2], and [Culhwch and Olwen][3] are all examples of this type of story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote from [Roger Loomis' review of Math Vab Mathonwy, An Inquiry into the Origins and Development of the Fourth Branch of the Mabingogi][4] (I didn't want to read the entire book):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The chief discovery is the ultimate dependence of Math upon the Irish myth of Balor and Lug for its main outline (pp.  65-112).  Significant is the fact that this myth, surviving most clearly in folktales taken down in the nineteenth century, must have supplied the framework for a story composed as early as the twelfth century.  It is a variant of the widespread formula of the King and His Prophesied Death (pp.  8, 366), of which the Perseus and Oedipus stories furnish familiar examples.  The plot of the famous Irish story may be reconstructed as follows...  Now the Welsh tale is remarkable in that it preserves practically every essential feature of this outline in the right order, but every feature has been recast several times, and all the original cohesion and rationale has been lost.  Math is at pains to preserve the virginity of a damsel, but no reason is offered and the damsel is not his daughter.  The damsel is ravished by stratagem, but nothing is said of her son.  Instead, the woman who takes her place gives birth to a son, Dylan, and he promptly goes to the sea and, instead of drowning, swims like a fish.  But it is not he who becomes the hero of the story but one who develops from the caul or placenta which Dylan's mother lets fall at the time of his birth.  This caul develops into a second child, and upon him are sworn successively the three geasa that were sworn upon Lug: but it is his mother who swears them, and she obviously has no motive.  The way in which she is induced to name him Lleu Llaw Gyffes is obviously reminiscent of the way in which Balor was induced to name his grandson Lug Lamfada.  **Finally, it is not Lleu's grandfather who is slain by a special spear, but Lleu's rival, Gronwy**.  Except that the order remains intact, the elements could hardly have been juggled more drastically.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A common feature in these types of stories is that the father-figure is very difficult to kill, and can only be killed in strange and esoteric ways. Here's an example from Culhwch and Olwen, a story from the same tradition as Math. (The story of Balor and Lug, upon which Math is based upon, also includes a father figure who is hard to kill).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; And the third day they returned to the palace. And Yspaddaden Penkawr said to them, &quot;Shoot not at me again unless you desire death. Where are my attendants? Lift up the forks of my eyebrows which have fallen over my eyeballs, that I may see the fashion of my son-in-law.&quot; Then they arose, and, as they did so, Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilhwch caught it and threw it vigorously, and wounded him through the eyeball, so that the dart came out at the back of his head. &quot;A cursed ungentle son-in-law, truly! As long as I remain alive, my eyesight will be the worse. Whenever I go against the wind, my eyes will water; and peradventure my head will burn, and I shall have a giddiness every new moon. Cursed be the fire in which it was forged. Like the bite of a mad dog is the stroke of this poisoned iron.&quot; And they went to meat.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Since Lleu takes the role of the father figure in this rearranged story, it also makes sense that he is hard to kill.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# An attempted explanation of the symbolism behind Lleu's position:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The easiest answer is that the position is the answer to the riddle: he can't be killed &quot;inside or outside,&quot; so he straddles both worlds and becomes vulnerable. However, this doesn't explain why he needs to do this.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I've done quite a bit of research into the symbolism of Lleu's death, and having read several sources and talked to a few experts, I'm forced to conclude that no agreed upon explanation exists. However, I have seen a few theories, which I outline below:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's important to know that Lleu seems to be associated with the sun. According to [Queen of the Night: Rediscovering the Celtic Moon Goddess][5]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In the Mabinogi, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Bright One of the Skillful Hand) is transformed into an eagle, residing for a period of time in the top of an oak tree. The eagle and the oak are symbols of a solar or celestial deity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found an article that [claims that the position that Lleu can be killed corresponds to something related to astronomy][100] (the hut to the sky, the tub/well to the milky way, the goat represents Capella, and Lleu to the constellation Perseus [Perseus seems to have a foot in the milkyway]). The article seems legit, and is definitely worth considering, but I worry that it doesn't seem to be verified by any academics. Here's a picture of the constellation Perseus (from [AstroPixels.com][7]):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;![The constellation Perseus](http://astropixels.com/constellations/charts/images/Per_map.jpg)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another explanation (found in an article about Shakespeare!) ties the age of the spear to the creation of a new year (and perhaps to rebirth):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Blodeuwedd and her lover planned to slay her husband, the Welsh hero Lleu Llaw Gyffes; but he could only be killed by a spear forged &quot;in a year of Sundays&quot;; and so Lleu was struck down exactly one year after the plan was conceived. The death of the year equated the death of the husband; either event signals or is signaled by the Queen's or Lady's attachment to another man.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Aguirre, Manuel. [Life, Crown, and Queen: Gertrude and the Theme of Sovereignty][8].)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And as a bonus, here's an article that elaborates on the connection between names, transformations, and the difference between Lleu's and Blodeuwedd's metamorphoses:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The metamorphoses of Lleu and Blodeu(w)edd confirm the theory that, in the Fourth Branch, names function to secure both body and identity. The scene in which Lleu spontaneously transforms into an eagle and the earlier scene in which he is named are linked in such a way that his name emerges as a crucial guarantee of human embodiment; by contrast, Blodeu(w)edd is renamed so that her metamorphosis can never be undone.  Having persuaded her husband, Lleu, to reveal how he may be killed, Blodeu(w)edd has Gronw ambush Lleu while he is demonstrating to his wife exactly the point at which he is at his most vulnerable. Gronw’s ambush prompts Lleu’s transformation: “Then Gronw rose up from the hill that is called Brynn Cyfergyr, and he got up on the end of one knee, and cast the poison-spear, and hit [Lleu] in the side, so that the spear shaft leapt from him and the head stayed in him. And then he went flying up in the shape of an eagle, and gave a terrible cry” (Williams 1951, 88). Although the text gives more details about the spear thrust than the metamorphosis, Lleu’s transformation clearly results from the entry of the spearhead into his body. This passage mirrors the episode in which the young Lleu is named. In this scene, disguised, Gwydion brings the boy to visit Aranrhod; when Aranrhod sees the boy hit a wren with surprising precision and comments on his dexterity, saying, “it is with a skilful hand Lleu can be killed only by a single blow from a spear made only during Sunday mass over the course of one year, and he must be neither inside nor outside, neither on horseback nor on foot; the inventive solution to this riddle involves Lleu’s standing with one foot on the edge of a roofed outdoor bathtub, the other on the back of a goat. The actions in both scenes are also described by identical verbs, bwrw (to throw, cast) and medru (to strike). Sheehan that the fair one hit it [ Ys llaw gyffes y medrwys y lleu ef ]” (Williams 1951, 80), Gwydion manipulates her comment to provide a name for his nephew, Lleu Llaw Gyffes (Fair-haired One of the Skilful Hand). Lleu’s name is also the key to his metamorphosis’s reversal. When Gwydion finds the eagle perched in a treetop, he sings three englynion , each time naming Lleu, until the eagle descends from the tree and alights on Gwydion’s knee; Gwydion is then able to strike him with the hutlath “so that he was in his own shape [ rith ]” (Williams 1951, 90). Lleu’s metamorphosis is consistent with those examined above, in that the narrator does not refer to Lleu by name until he is again in his own, human body. Lleu cannot regain his body until he regains his name: it is Gwydion’s ritualized poetic naming of his nephew together with a tap of the hutlath that restores Lleu to human form. Gronw’s skillful striking of Lleu causes Lleu to lose both name and form by reversing the subject positions (active/passive, striker/struck) of the scenario whereby he gained his name&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Sheehan, Sarah, [Matrilineal Subjects: Ambiguity, Bodies, and Metamorphosis in the Fourth Branch of the Mabinogi][9])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perseus&#xD;&#xA;[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tristan_and_Iseult&#xD;&#xA;[3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culhwch_and_Olwen&#xD;&#xA;[4]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2847153&#xD;&#xA;[5]: https://books.google.com/books?id=1l1yXq4xGHsC&amp;pg=PA153&amp;lpg=PA153&amp;dq=lleu+llaw+gyffes+eagle+symbolism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JFo9N9d_Hh&amp;sig=ejmr1zvfmO7oQcar6g4KWDbQjcQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_xmKVcmTGsn2ggSS9IGADA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=lleu%20llaw%20gyffes%20eagle%20symbolism&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;[6]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html&#xD;&#xA;[7]: http://astropixels.com/&#xD;&#xA;[8]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/518100&#xD;&#xA;[9]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/591089&#xD;&#xA;[100]: http://mabinogionastronomy.blogspot.com/2015/04/thedeath-of-lleu-llaw-gyffes-here-is.html" />

In fact, even scholarship from as late as the 70s need serious reworking due to new data as well as new understandings. Thus the march of progress.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Despite this, there is some good in Frazer. Beyond being entertainment and a wealth of literary inspiration, the basic school in which it is centered, the Cambridge ritualist school, still produces a viable interpretation of ancient myth. Problem is, history, archaeology, and comparative methods have moved far beyond what Frazer was even capable of offering. Barbara Kowalzig's *Singing for the Gods* is a great new (well, 2007) book showing how to do it right these days.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;But as for Frazer's book in particular, he is perhaps most outdated by his excessive speculation and assumptions. It is one thing to formulate a hypothesis about an origin of a particular myth or folkloric tale, quite another to ignore many differences between cobbled 'parallels' and make what are quite fanciful reconstructions of &quot;savage humanity&quot; from them, generalizing without controlling for locally-produced or contextually-driven origins. It's not sound scholarship to assume your version first and then assume divergent versions diverge from your assumed version. Frazer is guilty of this to the extreme.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of that, he adds details where necessary to fit his theory. Even the central thesis, as many over the years have noticed, is quite an imaginative interpretation of a very innocent events. The question he originally attempted was good enough, essentially &quot;What's up with the priesthood of Diana of Nemi?&quot; What he ended up with—priest-kings, scapegoats, and complex, magical rituals—is missing from the scene, which, of course, must be why he generally dropped it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;All this and we're ignoring the major shift in anthropology which realized long ago that the &quot;progress from savagery to civilization&quot; is a false progress (the &quot;stages&quot; are a great example of bad generalization based on one flawed sample), that primordial mythology of &quot;savage beings&quot; is imaginary, a tall tale of the Victorian world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for entertainment, it undoubtedly is, and its influence is legendary, but no, do not read it for an understanding the complex history of quite nearly anything he says. He has flashes of insight, but you'd be better off looking elsewhere.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you want to look at some criticism of Frazer, I'd recommend these articles:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Beard, M. 1978. &quot;Judgments on James Frazer.&quot; *Daedalus* 107.4: 151–164.&#xD;&#xA;-- 1992. &quot;Frazer, Leach, and Virgil *Comparative Studies in Society and History* 34.2: 203–224.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Leach, E. 1961. &quot;Golden Bough or Gilded Twig?&quot; *Daedalus* 90: 371–399.&#xD;&#xA;-- 1965. &quot;On the 'Founding Fathers.' &quot; *Encounter* 25: 24–36.&#xD;&#xA;-- 1985. &quot;Reflections on a Visit to Nemi&quot; *Anthropology Today* 2–3.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Smith, J.

For example, in the book of Daniel (in biblical literature), the troubling dreams of the kings are announced, though no details are given for the sake of the literature. The point is that the king is &quot;testing&quot; his subjects, and will reward the interpreter that both knows what the dream is and can interpret it. Such a test, though, is a concocted fantasy of the literature; the main takeaway for us is that royal dreams are shared. (For more on this point, see M. H. Henze 1999 [*The Madness of King Nebuchadnezzar*](https://books.google.com/books?id=u1By9tEjh6AC), Brill.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A similar trial is done in Herodotus' _Histories_, in which the Lydian king Croesus asks Greek oracles about a dream, and only Delphi both knows what the dream is and correctly interprets it. Again, the secrecy and test are fictional, but dreams being shared fits a larger pattern of dream reports in the Ancient Near East.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The standard reference for the so-called &quot;dream reports&quot; is Oppenheim's 1956 [*Interpretation of Dreams in the Ancient Near East*](https://books.google.com/books?id=hlxTywAACAAJ), which was followed up well by Robert Gnuse's 1996 *[Dreams and Dream Reports in the Writings of Josephus](https://books.google.com/books?id=l23258NI8nQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)*, which is online if you want a fuller history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As for Oppenheim, I quote K. Bulkley, who summarizes the main point better than I could:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Oppenheim claims that almost all of these dream accounts have a primarily literary function, serving as plot devices used deliberately by the authors. Consequently, Oppenheim asserts that psychological inquiry into these dreams is vain, for it is highly unlikely, and impossible to prove, that these reports are based on genuine dream experiences (Oppenheim 1956, 185).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Bulkley then goes on, in fact, to examine Gilgamesh. She starts from where Oppenheim leaves off—that Gilgamesh fits this pattern—but then notes the differences, chiefly by observing that &quot;all the dreams in _Gilgamesh_) are evil dreams—frightening, confusing nightmares of struggle, violence, and death&quot; (161). This type of dream, like Nebuchadnezzar's in Daniel, &quot;require interpretation,&quot; and thus are not out of bounds to fall into the type that would be communicated as Gilgamesh does with Ninsun.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;K. Bulkey 1993, &quot;[The Evil Dreams of Gilgamesh: An Intersciplinary Approach to Dreams in Mythological Texts](https://books.google.com/books?id=oi0w-PKcjeQC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA159#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false),&quot; in C.

The half baked bread symbolises this: the bread is a union between two opposites, just like Gwyn's marriage. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The idea of bridging the human and supernatural worlds is a common theme in Celtic literature. This theme is especially prominent in stories about supernatural marriages, where the suitor has to venture into the supernatural world and bring back a wife. The father of the bride, and by extension the supernatural world, is usually hostile to the suitor's attempt attempt, and sets various challenges before the suitor (examples in this story being the bread challenge and the Gwyn's task to identify his bride from two identical woman). Thus, these types of stories have real world counterparts; the half baked bread can also be interpreted as harmonising the world of the husband with the world of the wife.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Alwyn Rees, Brinley Rees, Celtic Heritage: [Ancient Tradition in Ireland and Wales][2].  &#xD;&#xA;Juliette Wood, *[The Fairy Bride Legend in Wales][1]*.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1261034&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.amazon.com/Celtic-Heritage-Alwyn-Rees/dp/0500270392" />

However, the meaning of this varies between characters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some instances, having multiple pupils is a sign that the character has an &quot;evil eye.&quot; For example, in the Togail Bruidne Da Derga (The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel), a character with multiple pupils causes a juggler to drop his objects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A man ungentle, huge, fearful, uncouth was Ingcél. A single eye in his head, as broad as an oxhide, as black as a chafer, with three pupils therein.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When he was swiftest, I beheld him at the feat, and as I looked, they uttered a cry about him and they were all on the house-floor. Then the Prince who is in the house said to the juggler: ‘We have come together since thou wast a little boy, and till to-night thy juggling never failed thee.’’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ‘Alas, alas, fair master Conaire, good cause have I. A keen, angry eye looked at me: a man with the third of a pupil which sees the going of the nine bands. Not much to him is that keen, wrathful sight! Battles are fought with it,’ saith he. ‘It should be known till doomsday that there is evil in front of the Hostel.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Online translation of The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in works like the Táin Bó Cúalnge, having multiple pupils can be a sign of beauty or supernatural sight (or both). To quote from this fantastic paper titled ['The Evil Eye' in early Irish literature and law][2] (which is essentially the source for this entire answer):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The version that Ingcél has seven pupils in his eye has a parallel&#xD;&#xA;in descriptions of Cormac mac Airt and Cú Chulainn: they are&#xD;&#xA;said to have seven pupils in each eye. In both cases, this is explictly&#xD;&#xA;qualified as a sign of beauty. In Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension I, two of&#xD;&#xA;Cú Chulainn’s pupils are described as squinting, but the text supplies the&#xD;&#xA;comment that this was more an adornment than a disfigurement. The&#xD;&#xA;tradition of three pupils in Ingcél’s eye could be compared with another&#xD;&#xA;instance in Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension I: after the description of the&#xD;&#xA;poetess and prophetess Fedelm as a beautiful woman, it is said that she&#xD;&#xA;carries a weaver’s beam and has three pupils in each eye. There is no&#xD;&#xA;explanation offered of this characteristic: it could be a sign of beauty&#xD;&#xA;and it could be a sign of her supernatural sight. The latter is more&#xD;&#xA;probable, because the characteristic is separated from the description of&#xD;&#xA;her looks by the mention of the weaver’s beam. The weaver’s beam has&#xD;&#xA;been interpreted as a supernatural tool for prophesy. The triple pupils&#xD;&#xA;could, therefore, very well be a symbol of her clairvoyance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Borsje, Jacqueline; Kelly, Fergus: ['The evil eye' in early Irish literature and law.][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summery, depending on the character and story, having multiple pupils is associated with beauty, sharp site (i.e. clairvoyance), or destruction (i.e. &quot;the evil eye&quot;). If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend that you take a look at [the paper I cited about the evil eye][2]: it's very interesting and connects the phenomenon to Irish law and a variety of non-Irish texts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301017A.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bill.celt.dias.ie/vol4/displayObject.php?TreeID=1001" />

I don't know about the disclosure of the bones: that's going to take some more research (I'll update my answer if I find an answer).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Dragons&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The story of the *concealing* of the dragons is recounted in the Welsh tale [Llud a Llefelys][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  &quot;And the second plague,&quot; said he, &quot; that is in thy dominion, behold it is a dragon. And another dragon of a foreign race is fighting with it, and striving to overcome it. And therefore does your dragon make a fearful outcry. And on this wise mayest thou come to know this. After thou hast returned home, cause the Island to be measured in its length and breadth, and in the place where thou dost find the exact central point, there cause a pit to be dug, and cause a cauldron full of the best mead that can be made to be put in the pit, with a covering of satin over the face of the cauldron. And then, in thine own person do thou remain there watching, and thou wilt see the dragons fighting in the form of terrific animals. And at length they will take the form of dragons in the air. And last of all, after wearying themselves with fierce and furious fighting, they will fall in the form of two pigs upon the covering, and they will sink in, and the covering with them, and they will draw it down to the very bottom of the cauldron. And they will drink up the whole of the mead; and after that they will sleep. Thereupon do thou immediately fold the covering around them, and bury them in a kistvaen, in the strongest place thou hast in thy dominions, and hide them in the earth. And as long as they shall bide in that strong place no plague shall come to the Island of Britain from elsewhere.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And the story of their &quot;[disclosure&quot; is given both in Nennius' Historia Brittonum][2] and in [Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum][3]. I'm going to quote from Geoffrey because I find it easier to follow:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Unto whom spake Merlin: 'Know ye not what it is that doth hinder the foundation being laid of this tower? Ye have given counsel that the mortar thereof should be slacked of my blood, that so the tower should stand forthwith. Now tell me, what is it that lieth hid beneath the foundation, for somewhat is there that doth not allow it to stand?' But the wizards were adread and held their peace. Then saith Merlin, that is also called Ambrosius: 'My lord the King, call thy workmen and bid delve the soil, and a pool shalt thou find beneath it that doth forbid thy tower to stand.' And when this was done, straightway a pool was found under the earth, the which had made the soil unconstant. Then Ambrosius Merlin again came nigh unto the wizards and saith: 'Tell me now, ye lying flatterers, what is it that is under the pool?' But they were all dumb and answered&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; {p. 169}&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; {marg The magicians dumbfounded}unto him never a word. And again spake he unto the King, saying: 'Command, O King, that the pool be drained by conduits, and in the bottom thereof shalt thou behold two hollow stones and therein two dragons asleep.' The King, believing his words for that he had spoken true as touching the pool, commanded also that the pool should be drained. And when he found that it was even as Merlin had said he marvelled greatly. All they that stood by were no less astonished at such wisdom being found in him, deeming that he was possessed of some spirit of God.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;# Additional Commentary&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As a bonus, here's some additional commentary on the triad. First, Will Parker discusses the purpose of the triads:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  Finally, the burial of the fighting dragons at the end of this episodes recalls the talismanic concealment of Bendigeidfrân’s mortal remains at the end of the Second Branch, or those of Gwrthefyr as described in the Historia. The subsequent unearthing of these protective talismans is often lamented in the Welsh tradition, and is often used to explain why later generations were unable to resist the threatening gormesoedd as effectively as their mythological ancestors. As such, these ‘fortunate concealments’ and ‘unfortunate disclosures’ play an important part in the meta-narrative of sovereignty, loss and eventual restoration which we have seen played such a central role in Medievel Welsh historiography. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Will Parker, [Mabinogion.info][4])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And here's a quote discussion the inclusion of a dragon burial into the triad we're discussing:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As Ifor Willaims showed, the story of the burial of the dragons as given in Lludd a Llefelys is so closely dependent on HB's account of their disclosure as to indicate that this tale was invented subsequently to the ninth-century redaction of HB. Is it possible that in the triad the burial of the dragons has supplanted a third story of human talismanic burial? &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Trioedd Ynys Prydein: The Triads of the Island of Britain][book].

The ancients often distinguished between two such realms--the islands of the Blessed and the Lethean fields of Haides.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The two realms are for heroes and the virtuous, described as:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- &quot;White Island&quot; or &quot;The Islands of the Blessed&quot;, was an afterlife realm reserved for the heroes of myth. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- A netherworld realm that is located in the depths of Haides (beyond the river Lethe). A realm promised to &quot;initiates of the Mysteries&quot; who had lived a virtuous life.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, according to the website, Elysium was and still is an 'evolving concept', where&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Homer knows of no such realm, and consigns all of his heroes to the common house of Haides, while Hesiod and many other poets speak only of a paradisal realm reserved for heroes. Roman writers (such as Virgil) combine the two Elysia--the realm of the virtuous dead and the realm of heroes become one and the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An important note is that the term Elysium (and Haides) were not proper nouns in Ancient Greek, but rather as an adjective - the website provides examples:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  pedion Elysion (the Elysian plain) and domos Haidou (the domain or house of Haides). The etymology of elysion is unclear. It may be connected with the Greek verb eleusô (eleuthô), &quot;to relieve&quot; or &quot;release&quot; (i.e. from pain), and/or with the town Eleusis, site of the celebrated Eleusinian Mysteries.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An interesting description about the term &quot;Daughter of Elysium&quot; from the classic Ode to Joy from the Wikipedia article [Elysium: Post classical literature][2], is that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; After the Renaissance, an even cheerier Elysium evolved for some poets. Sometimes it is imagined as a place where heroes have continued their interests from their lives. Others suppose it is a location filled with feasting, sport, song; Joy is the &quot;daughter of Elysium&quot; in Friedrich Schiller's ode &quot;To Joy&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Particularly when the verse in its entirety is considered:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Joy, thou beauteous godly lighting,  &#xD;&#xA;Daughter of Elysium,  &#xD;&#xA;Fire drunken we are ent'ring  &#xD;&#xA;Heavenly, thy holy home!  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*Source: [The Schiller Institute][3]*&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Somewhat anecdotally related, in the past (many moons ago), I played Ode to Joy in an orchestra, when it gets into the full swing, one can imagine that they are among the heroes and virtuous of old in an environment that is joyous, brave and virtuous.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.theoi.com/Kosmos/Elysion.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elysium#Post-classical_literature&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.schillerinstitute.org/fid_91-96/931_Schiller_Ode.html" />

Acharya S is unscholarly, makes many silly mistakes, and thus is unreliable; and Maher's people obviously got his bullet points from the Acharya piece to which you linked in your question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Acharya throws up numerous points hoping that some of them will stick, but they don't. She doesn't cite any Egyptian texts that support her view, which is not surprising because there are none and, I would argue, there can be none. This is because the idea that Horus can be crucified and resurrected is logically precluded by Egypt's mythology and religious thinking. While a person is alive (taking the king as the example), he is Horus. But once you die, you become Osiris and are not Horus, so it can only be Osiris who is resurrected.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Not having any Egyptian texts to rely upon, Acharya relies on images of Horus with his arms out from his sides, and the idea that the Egyptian ankh and Christ's cross are the same. See [www.stellarhousepublishing.com/washoruscrucified.html](http://www.stellarhousepublishing.com/washoruscrucified.html) The ankh sign comes not from a cross but from a sandal strap (see Gardiner sign S34). In Egyptian, the ankh glyph is used to mean &quot;life&quot; as well as for the verb &quot;to live,&quot; but it never is an agency of death; in Egypt no one ever dies on an ankh, much less is crucified on one. There are no such images in the iconography, since crucifixion was not practiced in ancient Egypt (at least before Roman times). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Further, a figure holding out his arms in itself says nothing about death or crucifixion, or a cross or Christ. Acharya's notion reminds me of Tertullian's laughable interpretation of Moses' surveying the Hebrews' (led by Joshua) battle against the Amalekites (Exod.17:8-13), where by standing on a hill and surveying the battle below, Moses (with help from Aaron and Hur) held his hands out to his sides and so caused the Hebrews to prevail. Tertullian claimed that this posture prefigured Christ and the cross, foretelling the cross through which Christ would be victorious over death and bring salvation. (Tertullian, *Against Marcion,* Book 3, Ch. 18.) No one would agree with such kinds of interpretations today. Yet Acharya relies on similarly ignorant/silly statements and wishful thinking by Church Fathers to support her claim.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In the past it has sometimes been claimed (e.g., by Wallis Budge, in his *Legends of the Gods* (1912), see http://sacred-texts.com/egy/leg/leg11.htm (among Egyptologists, Budge is no longer considered reliable)) that, in a myth recited on the Metternich Stela now on exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the child Horus is stung by a scorpion (which is Seth's doing), dies from the poison, and is resurrected by Thoth. But I know of no modern reading/translation of this text that has him dying rather than just unconscious and on the brink of death. The Stela's text itself says that &quot;the child was weak beyond answering,&quot; and &quot;refused the jar [of drink],&quot; which obviously means he is not dead. J.F. Borghouts, *Ancient Egyptian Texts* (1978), p. 63 (in lines 171-74 if the Stela). The scholarly discussions of the text accord with this interpretation. See Nora Scott, &quot;The Metternich Stela,&quot; The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin 9.8:201-17 (1951) (Horus is &quot;unconscious&quot; (p. 213); Scott was Research Fellow in the Egyptian Art Department at the Met); John Nunn, Ancient Egyptian Medicine, p. 110 (1996) (Horus is &quot;unconscious&quot;); Robert Ritner, *The Mechanics of Ancient Egyptian Magical Practice,* p. 57 n. 266 (1993) (Horus is &quot;injured&quot;);  Geraldine Pinch, *Magic in Ancient Egypt,* pp. 144-45 (1994) (Horus is &quot;too weak and ill to suckle&quot; and has a &quot;sickness&quot;); Emily Teeter, *Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt,* p. 175 (2011) (Horus was was &quot;cured&quot; by Thoth, which does not seem like a raising from the dead). This interpretation makes sense in terms of the magical spells recited that invoked this myth to cure victims of snakebite, scorpion stings, etc., who are *still alive;* they are not being brought back from the dead. For this purpose, the recovery of Horus was being used as a parallel example, so it made sense that he too was only on the brink of death. It is like the Billy Crystal scene in *The Princess Bride,* where his character Miracle Max observes that Wesley is &quot;only mostly dead,&quot; and then proceeds to bring him back.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, to put it bluntly, the idea is a load of Horuss**t." />

These sages are the philosophers that help shape the foundation of Chinese culture, society, and even politics. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because much of Eastern Asian culture, language, and philosophies were borrow from the Chinese to some extent, (I understand there are exceptions), for brevity I will just focus mostly on its Chinese origin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a work originating from before the [Xia Dynasty][1] of the [Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors) (三皇五帝, Sānhuáng wǔdì) (who there differ depending on the source, so I will not attempt to name them in order to avoid confusion). In it there are figure regarded as Three Sovereigns, regarded as &quot;god kings,&quot; they are the ultimate cultural heroes (and [regarded as demi-gods][2] in the myths) of Chinese history and described to have magical powers and credited with the basic technological inventions, social structure, and political norms of the time. During despot times these figures as said to have been invoked as paragons of leadership.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Five Emperors&quot; subsequently were regarded as legendary figures regarded as &quot;sages kings&quot; that are depicted perfect moral character. These figure were more worldly but historically intangible figures, like a mythical tribe leader, compared to the &quot;Three Sovereigns,&quot; who were considered divine beings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In essence these can be considered the first &quot;sages&quot; of Chinese legend. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Confucius is known to have revered these [Emperor Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao) and [Emperor Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun) (two of the Five Emperors, according to some sources), [Yu the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great) (described to be a decendant of the [Yellow Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor), one of the Three Soverigns by some sources) the [three true sages][3] 聖(人) (Shèng[rén]), the pinnicale of human perfection, the equivilant a saint in some regards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Taoism the equivalent would be &quot;[仙][4]&quot; (Xiān), (the character itself can mean hermit or rather literally &quot;mountain person&quot;［人＋山］), related to [Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Immortals_of_Huainan), but the meaning has [changed][4] quite a bit though time. Those the meaning of those two titles by themselves are the equivalent of the Buddhist term for the &quot;enlighten/awaken one&quot; (Buddha, which is [a title][5], not a name).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, the title of &quot;sage&quot; is what you would call an &quot;enlightened one,&quot; in a philosophical and/or spiritual sense. While the names may differ their destination are the same. Both Confucianism and Taoism walk the same path, but their ideals about it are different. Taoism seeks to free itself from worldly desires (as a hermit would live, confronting problem though the way of nature), but Confucianism is more about being a man of action, upholding the established hierarchy and fulfilling their given role as best they can (i.e. conquering problems thru cultivating intellect and morals). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://books.google.com/books?id=dmCZmnFBypEC&amp;lpg=PA511&amp;dq=sheng%20confucius%20yu%20shun%20yao%20sage&amp;pg=PA511#v=onepage&amp;q=sheng%20confucius%20yu%20shun%20yao%20sage&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Xian_(Daoist_immortal)&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jun/buddha.html&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)" />

Text="Before we can derive the mean behind the word, we need to first understand is where the term originates. These sages can be considered philosophers that use their to help shape the foundation of Chinese culture, society, and even politics. But is that all?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because much of Eastern Asian culture, language, and philosophies were borrowed from the Chinese to some extent, (I understand there are exceptions), for brevity. I will focus mostly on its Chinese origin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a work originating from before the [Xia Dynasty][1] of the [&quot;Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors) (三皇五帝, Sānhuáng wǔdì) (who they are differ depending on the source [see link]. I will not attempt to name them in order to avoid confusion). In it, there are three figure regarded as &quot;Three Sovereigns,&quot; who are hailed as &quot;god kings,&quot; and are considered the ultimate cultural heroes (and [regarded as demi-gods][2] in the myths) of Chinese history. They a chronicled to have magical powers and credited with the basic technological inventions, social structure, and political norms of the time. During despot times these figures as said to have been invoked as paragons of leadership.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Five Emperors&quot; subsequently were regarded as legendary figures regarded as &quot;sages kings&quot; that are depicted perfect moral character. These figure were more worldly but historically intangible figures, like a mythical tribe leader, compared to the &quot;Three Sovereigns,&quot; who were considered divine beings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In essence these can be considered the first &quot;sages&quot; of Chinese legend. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Confucius is known to have revered these figures, [Emperor Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao) and [Emperor Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun) (two of the Five Emperors, according to some sources), [Yu the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great) (described to be a decendant of the [Yellow Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor), one of the Three Soverigns by some sources) the [three true sages][3] 聖(人) (Shèng[rén]), as the pinnicale of human perfection, the equivilant a saint in some regards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Taoism the equivalent would be &quot;[仙][4]&quot; (Xiān), (the character itself can mean hermit or rather literally &quot;mountain person&quot;［人＋山］), related to [Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Immortals_of_Huainan), but the meaning has [changed][4] quite a bit though time. Those the meaning of those two titles by themselves are the equivalent of the Buddhist term for the &quot;enlighten/awaken one&quot; (Buddha, which is [a title][5], not a name).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, the title of &quot;sage&quot; is what you would call an &quot;enlightened one,&quot; in a philosophical and/or spiritual sense. While the names may differ their end destination are the same. Both Confucianism and Taoism walk the same path, but their ideals about it are different. Taoism seeks to free itself from worldly desires (as a hermit would live, confronting problem though the way of nature), but Confucianism is more about being a man of action, upholding the established hierarchy and fulfilling their given role as best they can (i.e. conquering problems thru cultivating intellect and morals). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://books.google.com/books?id=dmCZmnFBypEC&amp;lpg=PA511&amp;dq=sheng%20confucius%20yu%20shun%20yao%20sage&amp;pg=PA511#v=onepage&amp;q=sheng%20confucius%20yu%20shun%20yao%20sage&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Xian_(Daoist_immortal)&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jun/buddha.html&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)" />

But during the fifth century, the assimilation of specifically Trojans and Persians (i.e. Trojans in Persian trappings) was complete:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Attic black and red figure painters of the sixth and most of the fifth century persisted in depicting the Trojan in Hellenic dress indistinguishable fromthat of the Greeks...Paris furnishes some of the rare exceptions in the later sixth century by sometimes appearing in the costume of the &quot;Scythian archers&quot; so prevalent in Attic vase painting of this period.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; [By] the end of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., the depiction of the Trojans in Greek art had changed drastically; by then, they had assimilated the dress of Amazons or Persians.

Text="***By mistake I actually answered the questions why and how instead of when prior to answering when.***&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**In a nutshell**: If you are interested on the subject, read bellow. Otherwise, the accepted answer was pretty much the last edit of my post. While it's still probable that Bram Stoker did not think of the &quot;no reflection&quot; feature, it's considered his invention.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Vampires:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Vampires are ancient Balkan mythological being. The word actually depicts pretty much any form of non ethereal undead (contrary to the popular belief of capes, fangs and etc). As such their soul usually passed on to the next world.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It was believed that the mirror holds and reflects a part of your soul.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Like VixenPopuli said it can't reflect what you don't own.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This also explains why Chinese vampires are terrified of their reflection, because they are reminded that they have no soul.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also. back in the past, mirrors were made out of silver, and actually Balkan werewolves are considered a type of a vampire, so... if you add 2+2 u get 4. **It's quite possible that the modern myth is a combination of the silver and soul reflection theories.**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As of the earlier myths... lol we are talking about centuries BC. Times before any written language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In other words it's impossible to tell how it appeared, but the most plausible theories are: **No soul, thus No reflection** and **Bram Stoker's imagination and bad translations, born from lack of understanding.** &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I mean, Bram Stoker did pretty lame job at describing the vampires, but they were sort of &quot;the thing&quot; back in the days and everybody just went along with it, which eventually brought us Edward the sparkling fairy. So I won't be surprised if someone told him that vampires are terrified of mirrors, and he tried to guess why, which spawned the myth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Edit**: FAST google search:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Vampires][1] Wikipedia.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Link from the bibliography. Fixed.][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[China Vampires Jiangshi][3], another wikipedia Article.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Random][4] [articles][5] [which][6] [pretty][7] [much][8] [repeat][9] [what I just said.][10]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, asking a Bulgarian about vampires is like asking a netflix addicted zombie fan about the zombie apocalypse.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Now about the Stoker thing(or how he did a sloppy job, since in the comments OP's comment sort of implied that stoker didn't do nothing wrong). (**Warning** Off Topic):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 1. Gypsies are afraid of vampires and will not enter their territories. Actually they are far more superstitious than normal people.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 2. Wooden stake - Actually is a specific type of wood. Cornus also known  as dogwood. And it is not required to be a stake. Even a needle will help you. Since vampires are considered something like giant balloons full of blood. The word that describes the item is Шип which can be translated as pretty much everything in between a stake, spike and a big needle. Depending on the dialect. Also the heart is also a myth. **EDIT** this thing about the wood is only about the Balkan Vampires,the Chinese ones are slain by peach tree. So it can only be a tree that destroys evil. In other words a wooden stake will not help you in 905 of the cases.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 3. He completely skipped the &quot;cut their feet&quot; part. Yeah, you can kill vampires by cutting their feet so that won't get up and attack the living, which will make em die of starvation. Which is pretty much the usual way vampires were killed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 4. People don't fear vampires, they gang up to slay them when they are still young. Thus Frankenstein is more of a vampire book than Dracula.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; 5. Many many many other historical and translation issues. Yup Dracula was the Edward Cullen of the Victorian age. Sparkle, sparkle. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There were more but this post is not about this and I didn't finish the book. I made it up to like page +/- 150 of Dracula and it made me understand why people burned books back in the days...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;for more info write &quot;vampire burials/graves&quot; on google. It's full of info.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT 2:** Additional info. This time on Vampire myths instead of Stoker's mistakes.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. There is no popular, written story dating prior to Bram Stoker, claiming that vampires are not reflected in mirrors. Actually there are many things about vampires that appeared after Stoker wrote his novel. I wonder why?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. Vampires, and bloodsuckers in general are far older than the bible itself and appear through out the history in almost all mythology from China to Egypt and eastern Europe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The only known ancient vampires, prior to the book Dracula, that were related to mirrors, were the Chinese ones. Also they had reflection, it's just that it scared them instead of not appearing. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;4. Stoker spawned a huge cult to his creation, not the mythological being vampyr. The Mythological creature vampyr is only remotely related to Dracula. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;5. The mirror is most probably derivation created from combining various sources describing different types of vampires.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also another shady source: Knowing your country's history. Also there were many authors that Mentioned in many of their books, the original vampires. Authors like Jordan Radichkov, Ivan Vazov and many others. They all describe different vampires.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**EDIT 3:** There are people that actually said it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ok, I came back and did a quick google search. One of the 1st [links][11]. I quote:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; One very famous trait Stoker added is the inability to be seen in&#xD;&#xA;&gt; mirrors, which is not something found in traditional Eastern European&#xD;&#xA;&gt; folklore.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, warping mythology is not modern mythology. If tomorrow someone says that Centaurs were half fishes half penguins, and it becomes a thing, it will not be considered a mythology. The mythological being will still be a man who has a body of a horse instead of his bottom half.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://bg.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%92%D0%B0%D0%BC%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%80&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.protobulgarians.com/PODSTRANITSA%20NA%20DR%20ZHIVKO%20VOYNIKOV/PRALULG-DIAL-DUM-1.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jiangshi#Methods_and_items_used_to_counter_jiangshis&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://dariknews.bg/view_article.php?article_id=1350208&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://mgpz.org/mitoveizagadki/drugi/vampir.html&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://www.burgasnews.com/ezoterika-i-misterii/74275-vnimavaite-s-ogledaloto-mozhe-da-krie-dushata-vi&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.trud.bg/Article.asp?ArticleId=4451362&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://listverse.com/2010/09/30/8-vampire-myths-explained/&#xD;&#xA;  [9]: http://www.fvza.org/vmyths.html&#xD;&#xA;  [10]: http://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/38466/is-there-a-reason-given-as-to-why-vampires-reflections-cannot-be-seen&#xD;&#xA;  [11]: http://dracula.cc/literature/bram_stoker_dracula/" />

The ellyllon, or the elves;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. The coblynau, or the mine fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The bwbachod, or the household fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. The gwragedd annwn, or the fairies of the lakes and streams;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. The gwyllion, or the mountain fairies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here, the classification of Welsh fairies distinguished household fairies from that of the mines, lakes and mountains. Like the Irish tradition, the Welsh can be further divided into solitary and social fairies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found [the text of *British Goblins*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34704/34704-h/34704-h.htm), where Sikes states (at the start of Chapter II)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Fairies being creatures of the imagination, it is not possible to classify them by fixed and immutable rules. In the exact sciences, there are laws which never vary, or if they vary, their very eccentricity is governed by precise rules. Even in the largest sense, comparative mythology must demean itself modestly in order to be tolerated in the severe company of the sciences. In presenting his subjects, therefore, the writer in this field can only govern himself by the purpose of orderly arrangement. To secure the maximum of system, for the sake of the student who employs the work for reference and comparison, with the minimum of dullness, for the sake of the general reader, is perhaps the limit of a reasonable ambition. Keightley[8] divides into four classes the Scandinavian elements of popular belief as to fairies, viz.:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. The Elves;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. The Dwarfs, or Trolls;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The Nisses; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. The Necks, [12] Mermen, and Mermaids.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How entirely arbitrary this division is, the student of Scandinavian folk-lore at once perceives. Yet it is perhaps as satisfactory as another. The fairies of Wales may be divided into five classes, if analogy be not too sharply insisted on. Thus we have&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. The Ellyllon, or elves;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. The Coblynau, or mine fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The Bwbachod, or household fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. The Gwragedd Annwn, or fairies of the lakes and streams; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. The Gwyllion, or mountain fairies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Keightley&quot; refers to Thomas Keightley, the author of *Fairy Mythology*, from 1870. I found [an index of all its parts](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/index.htm). This is certainly harder to search through, but in [his analysis on Ireland](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm132.htm), Keightley writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The fairies of Ireland can hardly be said to differ in any respect from those of England and Scotland. Like them they are of diminutive size, rarely exceeding two feet in height; they live also in society, their ordinary abode being the interior of the mounds, called in Irish, Raths (Rahs), in English, Moats, the construction of which is, by the peasantry, ascribed to the Danes from whom, it might thence perhaps be inferred, the Irish got their fairies direct and not vid England.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [the more general summary of Celtic fairies](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm131.htm), he writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yet in the popular creed of all these tribes, we meet at the present day beings exactly corresponding to the Dwarfs and Fairies of the Gotho-German nations. Of these beings there is no mention in any works--such as the Welsh Poems, and Mabinogion, the Poems of Ossian, or the different irish poems and romances--which can by any possibility lay claim to an antiquity anterior to the conquests of the Northmen. Is it not then a reasonable supposition that the Picts, Saxons, and other sons of the North, brought with them their Dwarfs and Kobolds, and communicated the knowledge of, and belief in, them to their Celtic and Cymric subjects and neighbours? Proceeding on this theory, we have placed the Celts and Cymry next to and after the Gotho-German nations, though they are perhaps their precursors in Europe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [his introduction to the fairies of Great Britain as a whole](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm105.htm) (though perhaps ecluding the Celts), he writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We have already seen that the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain had in their language the terms from which are derived Elf and Dwarf, and the inference is natural that their ideas respecting these beings corresponded with those of the Scandinavians and Germans. The same may be said. of the Picts, who, akin to the Scandinavians, early seized on the Scottish Lowlands. We therefore close our survey of the Fairy Mythology of the Gotho-German race with Great Britain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So there are quite a few parallels between Norse elves and Celtic fairies." />

These sages can be considered philosophers that use their wisdom to help shape the foundation of Chinese culture, society, and even politics. But is that all?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Because much of Eastern Asian culture, language, and philosophy were borrowed from the Chinese to some extent, (I understand there are exceptions), for brevity I will focus mostly on its Chinese origin.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a work originating from before the [Xia Dynasty][1] concerning the [&quot;Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors&quot;](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Sovereigns_and_Five_Emperors) (三皇五帝, Sānhuáng wǔdì) (who they are differ depending on the source [see link]. I will not attempt to name them in order to avoid confusion). In it, there are three figures regarded as &quot;Three Sovereigns,&quot; who are hailed as &quot;god kings,&quot; and are considered the ultimate cultural heroes (and [regarded as demi-gods][2] in the myths) of Chinese history. They are said to have had magical powers and are credited with the basic technological inventions, social structure, and political norms of the time. During despotic times these figures are said to have been invoked as paragons of leadership.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The &quot;Five Emperors&quot; subsequently were regarded as legendary figures,&quot;sages kings&quot; depicted with perfect moral character. These figure were more worldly but historically intangible figures, like a mythical tribe leader, compared to the &quot;Three Sovereigns,&quot; who were considered divine beings.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In essence these can be considered the first &quot;sages&quot; of Chinese legend. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Confucius is known to have revered these figures, [Emperor Yao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Yao) and [Emperor Shun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor_Shun) (two of the Five Emperors, according to some sources), [Yu the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great) (described to be a decendant of the [Yellow Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_Emperor), one of the Three Soverigns by some sources) the [three true sages][3] 聖(人) (Shèng[rén]), as the pinnacle of human perfection, the equivalent of a saint in some regards.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In Taoism the equivalent would be &quot;[仙][4]&quot; (Xiān), (the character itself can mean hermit or rather literally &quot;mountain person&quot;［人＋山］), related to [Eight Immortal Scholars of the Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_Immortals_of_Huainan), but the meaning has [changed][4] quite a bit over time. Thus the meaning of those two titles by themselves are the equivalent of the Buddhist term for the &quot;enlightened/awakened one&quot; (Buddha, which is [a title][5], not a name).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, the title of &quot;sage&quot; is what you would call an &quot;enlightened one,&quot; in a philosophical and/or spiritual sense. While the names may differ their end destinations are the same. Both Confucianism and Taoism walk the same path, but their ideals about it are different. Taoism seeks to free itself from worldly desires (as a hermit would live, confronting problems through the way of nature), but Confucianism is more about being a man of action, upholding the established hierarchy and fulfilling their given role as best they can (i.e. conquering problems through cultivating intellect and morals). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xia_dynasty&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_cult&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://books.google.com/books?id=dmCZmnFBypEC&amp;lpg=PA511&amp;dq=sheng%20confucius%20yu%20shun%20yao%20sage&amp;pg=PA511#v=onepage&amp;q=sheng%20confucius%20yu%20shun%20yao%20sage&amp;f=false&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Xian_(Daoist_immortal)&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jun/buddha.html&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xian_(Taoism)" />

Rather intimidating all told.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The fullest description occurs after the slaying of the boy troop of Emain Macha.  Kinsella's translation puts it this way:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The first warp-spasm seized Cúchulainn, and made him into a monstrous thing, hideous and shapeless, unheard of. His shanks and his joints, every knuckle and angle and organ from head to foot, shook like a tree in the flood or a reed in the stream. His body made a furious twist inside his skin, so that his feet and shins switched to the rear and his heels and calves switched to the front... On his head the temple-sinews stretched to the nape of his neck, each mighty, immense, measureless knob as big as the head of a month-old child... he sucked one eye so deep into his head that a wild crane couldn't probe it onto his cheek out of the depths of his skull; the other eye fell out along his cheek. His mouth weirdly distorted: his cheek peeled back from his jaws until the gullet appeared, his lungs and his liver flapped in his mouth and throat, his lower jaw struck the upper a lion-killing blow, and fiery flakes large as a ram's fleece reached his mouth from his throat... The hair of his head twisted like the tangle of a red thornbush stuck in a gap; if a royal apple tree with all its kingly fruit were shaken above him, scarce an apple would reach the ground but each would be spiked on a bristle of his hair as it stood up on his scalp with rage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Which is actually fairly concise, compared to the [very direct translation of Joseph Dunn](http://adminstaff.vassar.edu/sttaylor/Cooley/ScythedChariot.html), which goes on for four paragraphs in full description of the process.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then took place the first twisting-fit and rage of the royal hero Cuchulain, so that he made a terrible, many-shaped, wonderful, unheard of thing of himself. His flesh trembled about him like a pole against the torrent or like a bulrush against the stream, every member and every joint and every point and every knuckle of him from crown to ground. He made a mad whirling-feat of his body within his hide. His feet and his shins and his knees slid so that they came behind him. His heels and his calves and his hams shifted so that they passed to the front. The muscles of his calves moved so that they came to the front of his shins, so that each huge knot was the size of a soldier's balled fist. He stretched the sinews of his head so that they stood out on the nape of his neck, hill-like lumps, huge, incalculable, vast, immeasurable and as large as the head of a month-old child.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He next made a ruddy bowl of his face and his countenance. He gulped down one eye into his head so that it would be hard work if a wild crane succeeded in drawing it out on to the middle of his cheek from the rear of his skull. Its mate sprang forth till it came out on his cheek. His mouth was distorted monstrously. He drew the cheek from the jaw-bone so that the interior of his throat was to be seen. His lungs and his lights stood out so that they fluttered in his mouth and his gullet. He struck a mad lion's blow with the upper jaw on its fellow so that as large as a wether's fleece of a three year old was each red, fiery flake which his teeth forced into his mouth from his gullet.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; There was heard the loud clap of his heart against his breast like the yelp of a howling bloodhound or like a lion going among bears. There were seen the torches of the Badb, and the rain clouds of poison, and the sparks of glowing-red fire, blazing and flashing in hazes and mists over his head with the seething of the truly wild wrath that rose up above him. His hair bristled all over his head like branches of a redthorn thrust into a gap in a great hedge. Had a king's apple-tree laden with royal fruit been shaken around him, scarce an apple of them all would have passed over him to the ground, but rather would an apple have stayed stuck on each single hair there, for the twisting of the anger which met it as it rose from his hair above him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The Lon Laith ('Champion's Light') stood out of his forehead, so that it was as long and as thick as a warrior's whetstone. As high, as thick, as strong, as steady, as long as the sail-tree of some huge prime ship was the straight spout of dark blood which arose right on high from the very ridge-pole of his crown, so that a black fog of witchery was made thereof like to the smoke from a king's hostel what time the king comes to be ministered to at nightfall of a winter's day.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just for fun, a number of comics have been made about and inspired by Cuchulain and the Tain.

The ellyllon, or the elves;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. The coblynau, or the mine fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The bwbachod, or the household fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. The gwragedd annwn, or the fairies of the lakes and streams;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. The gwyllion, or the mountain fairies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Here, the classification of Welsh fairies distinguished household fairies from that of the mines, lakes and mountains. Like the Irish tradition, the Welsh can be further divided into solitary and social fairies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I found [the text of *British Goblins*](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/34704/34704-h/34704-h.htm), where Sikes states (at the start of Chapter II)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Fairies being creatures of the imagination, it is not possible to classify them by fixed and immutable rules. In the exact sciences, there are laws which never vary, or if they vary, their very eccentricity is governed by precise rules. Even in the largest sense, comparative mythology must demean itself modestly in order to be tolerated in the severe company of the sciences. In presenting his subjects, therefore, the writer in this field can only govern himself by the purpose of orderly arrangement. To secure the maximum of system, for the sake of the student who employs the work for reference and comparison, with the minimum of dullness, for the sake of the general reader, is perhaps the limit of a reasonable ambition. Keightley[8] divides into four classes the Scandinavian elements of popular belief as to fairies, viz.:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. The Elves;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. The Dwarfs, or Trolls;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The Nisses; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. The Necks, [12] Mermen, and Mermaids.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; How entirely arbitrary this division is, the student of Scandinavian folk-lore at once perceives. Yet it is perhaps as satisfactory as another. The fairies of Wales may be divided into five classes, if analogy be not too sharply insisted on. Thus we have&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 1. The Ellyllon, or elves;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 2. The Coblynau, or mine fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 3. The Bwbachod, or household fairies;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 4. The Gwragedd Annwn, or fairies of the lakes and streams; and&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 5. The Gwyllion, or mountain fairies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Keightley&quot; refers to Thomas Keightley, the author of *Fairy Mythology*, from 1870. I found [an index of all its parts](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/index.htm). This is certainly harder to search through, but in [his analysis on Ireland](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm132.htm), Keightley writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The fairies of Ireland can hardly be said to differ in any respect from those of England and Scotland. Like them they are of diminutive size, rarely exceeding two feet in height; they live also in society, their ordinary abode being the interior of the mounds, called in Irish, Raths (Rahs), in English, Moats, the construction of which is, by the peasantry, ascribed to the Danes from whom, it might thence perhaps be inferred, the Irish got their fairies direct and not vid England.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [the more general summary of Celtic fairies](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm131.htm), he writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Yet in the popular creed of all these tribes, we meet at the present day beings exactly corresponding to the Dwarfs and Fairies of the Gotho-German nations. Of these beings there is no mention in any works--such as the Welsh Poems, and Mabinogion, the Poems of Ossian, or the different irish poems and romances--which can by any possibility lay claim to an antiquity anterior to the conquests of the Northmen. Is it not then a reasonable supposition that the Picts, Saxons, and other sons of the North, brought with them their Dwarfs and Kobolds, and communicated the knowledge of, and belief in, them to their Celtic and Cymric subjects and neighbours? Proceeding on this theory, we have placed the Celts and Cymry next to and after the Gotho-German nations, though they are perhaps their precursors in Europe.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In [his introduction to the fairies of Great Britain as a whole](http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/celt/tfm/tfm105.htm) (though perhaps ecluding the Celts), he writes&#xD;&#xA;&gt; We have already seen that the Anglo-Saxon conquerors of Britain had in their language the terms from which are derived Elf and Dwarf, and the inference is natural that their ideas respecting these beings corresponded with those of the Scandinavians and Germans. The same may be said. of the Picts, who, akin to the Scandinavians, early seized on the Scottish Lowlands. We therefore close our survey of the Fairy Mythology of the Gotho-German race with Great Britain.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So there are quite a few parallels between Norse elves and Celtic fairies:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - The elves are akin to the ellyllon&#xD;&#xA; - The dwarves and trolls are akin to the coblynau&#xD;&#xA; - The nisses are akin to the bwbachod&#xD;&#xA; - The necks, men and mermaids are akin to the gwragedd annwn" />

This would be most inline with Italic and Etruscan Gods, who lived in the skies, upon teh earth, under the earth, in the waters. A river god would live in his river, a goddess of the land in her land. The lares and penates lived in the houses or with the families they protected. This has been published widely (e.g. [L.B. van der Meer, 1987](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bronze-Liver-Piacenza-Polytheistic-Archaeology/dp/9070265419/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1439394945&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=piacenza+liver)). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jupiter, like most Roman deities is most cognate with Etruscan and Italic deities. When the Romans conquered Greece, they found many similarities between their own gods and goddesses and those of the Greeks. The most likely explanation is that many (though not all) of the Greek gods were derived of Etruscan origins, like the Roman gods. Others were from the East, such as Dionysos, and Hekate.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It seems unlikely that the Roman pantheon was &quot;infected&quot; with Greek influences, before Greece was conquered, as the only similarities are the ones that likely stem from Etruscan origin. Not a single Greek influence that was of Eastern origin made it into Roman mythology until well after the contacts with Greek colonies in Southern Italy or even the conquest of Greece, which would be statistically most unlikely if the Greeks had &quot;infected&quot; the Roman pantheon before they were conquered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It would therefore surprise me if Roman Gods lived on Mount Olympos. I think it would be almost impossible for such a notion to have existed in the centuries of Roman mythology before the conquest of Greece, and even after the conquest of Greece, if such a change had happened, one would have assumed there would be explicit mentioning of this. More explicit than Seneca's [Hercules Furens](http://www.theoi.com/Text/SenecaHerculesFurens.html).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even if later in the Roman empire there had been &quot;infection&quot; of Roman religious beliefs by Greek mythology, and even if every single text proving that got lost, does Hercules Furens prove anything. In that text Seneca never claims any God lives on Olympos. He only says Jupiter &lt;i&gt;rules&lt;/i&gt; Olympos, but in the same play Jupiter is said to rule several other places as well: the infernal world (line 46-62 and 592-615), the heavens (line 709-730) and all fires (line 926-938). If ruling something means he lives in it, then at the very least Jupiter lives in many places.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Many Roman deities have epiteths tying them to a place. Perhaps those refer to places where they live?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Before the epic of Gilgamesh was put together as one single narrative, hymns of Gilgamesh were performed separately. These are the Sumerian predecessors of what's commonly read today. They can fortunately for us be easily found on the internet at [The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature (ETCSL)](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.8.1*).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As you can see, there were several hymns in the Gilgamesh cycle, and the bull of Heaven is one of them. All of these except Gilgamesh and Aga were eventually incorporated into a single narrative. This seems to have happened first ca. 2000-1600 BCE. What's often translated and put into books, however, is a recension of this text made roughly a thousand years later. By that time, it would be too late to remove it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Historically, the scene has to be rather late overall. The original story was probably the hymn of [Gilgamesh and Aga](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.1.8.1.1). Aga (also Akka) in the myths was the son of Enmebaragesi, king of Kish, whom we know now was actually a real person from inscriptions[1]. A plausible scenario for the development of Gilgamesh follows:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Enmebaragesi of Kish ruled over Sumer, and was succeeded by Aga, who was then conquered by Gilgamesh of Uruk, leading to Uruk's predominance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This could have (and would have) been ritually performed at Uruk, where Gilgamesh could then fade into legends. Furthermore, other myths would be attracted to it. First, the Humbaba quest likely originated with the Ur III dynasty.[2] Originally entirely separate from the Gilgamesh cycle, the story of Dumuzi and Inanna is well chronicled in the Sumerian literature. You can also read them at the [ETCSL](http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=c.1.4*). The older view, established by Frazer, was to see Dumuzi was a dying and rising fertility god, but as JoAnn Scurlock points out, the evidence for that is very weak.[3] Instead, he appears to:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; embrace [the onerous duties of kingship], and to suffer the ultimate penalty for failure.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this reading is correct, it explains why Dumuzi, lover of Inanna (later Ishtar) became the predecessor of Gilgamesh (and defeater of Enmebaragesi), itself evidenced by the unusual name appearing as a doublet (he's distinguished in the sources, but it's clear it was one name that became two).[5] Dumuzi would be the example of a king failing at his duties, while Gilgamesh would have been a good king (the part about Gilgamesh being a bad king in the beginning is missing in the Sumerian hymns and is presumably a later addition).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Ritually, it appears that there was a differentiation of some sort between Dumuzi and Gilgamesh. The Inanna/Dumuzi relationship looks similar to other goddess/dead mortal ones. Beyond them, we have Adonis and Aphrodite (Adonis actually comes from the Semitic root _adon_ which means &quot;lord&quot;, and was a title for Tammuz, the Babylonian version of Dumuzi; Aphrodite has similar myths to Inanna/Ishtar, e.g. she's insulted by Diomedes in the _Iliad_ and reacts suspiciously similar to Ishtar when she's insulted by Gilgamesh, i.e. going up to heaven and crying to her parents; [Homer, _Iliad_, 5.297–430](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad5.htm#_Toc239244903)), Cybele and Attis, and perhaps too Aphrodite and Paris.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These couples mean something—though what exactly it's difficult to say—about the function of kingship in ancient Sumer and Babylon. The king was also the chief priest, and there seems to be some sort of relationship between the king and the goddess, as you can see from my post on [Shulgi and Inanna](http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/962/are-there-kali-types-deities-in-other-pantheons/965#965).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;At this point we can only speculate, but perhaps Gilgamesh's rejection of her is tied to a religious dispute or a political dispute? If there is any truth about Gilgamesh's involvement in the building of the temple of Ninlil as recorded in the [Tummal inscription](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummal_Inscription), then there might have been rivalry between worshipers of Ninlil and Inanna that played out in Gilgamesh's favoring of the former over the latter. It's difficult to say for sure, and of course, all this is not only hypothetical, but also likely to remain unanswerable.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Interestingly, Homer in the [Iliadic parallel](http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Greek/Iliad5.htm#_Toc239244903), used it for polemic against the claims of Aphrodite as a warrior goddess, since Zeus chides her for trying to engage in combat. We know that in Cyprus, where there was a strong Phoenician population, Aphrodite *was* dressed in warrior garb. I think there's something there.)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![Aphrodite in warrior garb. Mosaic, found in Paphos, Cyprus][6]][7]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Aphrodite in warrior garb. Mosaic, found in Paphos, Cyprus)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Narratologically, the inclusion of the scene makes sense for the overall story, and in fact is one of the more important parts. One of the important themes of the work as a whole is the acceptance of death for mortals. Recall that the original impetus for the slaying of Humbaba is for eternal glory: &quot;I will establish for ever a name eternal!&quot; ([Y 187](https://books.google.com/books?id=eCZRK_61adMC&amp;pg=PA20), trans. Andrew George). In order for Gilgamesh to really seek out immortality (almost always denied to mortals, with Ziusudra being the one exception), he must gain a reason for wanting it. This is accomplished in the death of his friend, Enkidu. And who else, except Inanna, who already was responsible for the death of Dumuzi, would be implicated? The association between the two would be even stronger since there are hints of immortality in the Dumuzi hymns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Thus this scene provides that pivotal climax which leads him to seek out immortality and ultimately the acceptance of his fate, since it is Enkidu from the Netherworld he sees.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://books.google.com/books?id=bCn5-COYETwC&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://books.google.com/books?id=cxjuHTH6I2sC&amp;pg=PA78&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://books.google.com/books?id=9UeVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA161&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://books.google.com/books?id=9UeVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: https://books.google.com/books?id=5gUNVtrlr28C&amp;pg=PA102&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://i.stack.imgur.com/8l9hj.jpg&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: https://www.flickr.com/photos/j-fish/galleries/72157632964336921/&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;----------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;General Bibliography&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Jean-Jacques Glassner and Benhamin R.

According to the *Yan City District Report* and the *Ancient Yan City Bian Genealogy Chart*, in the waning years of the Yuan Dynasty, the son of Bian Shi Zheng, Bian Yuan Hen of Yan City Bianchang Region was extremely strong when young. There were tigers in the region which made nobody dare to travel alone. Once, Bian Yuan Hen travelled alone, and killed a tiger with his bare hands during his travels. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The second theory ([source][3], [source][2]) seems to suggest (as per Semaphore's comment) that Wu Song was an assassin who killed a local official (nicknamed Cai &quot;Tiger&quot;) and was then tortured to death in prison.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;历史上有这么一个武松，他原是浪迹江湖的卖艺人，曾为杭州知府中的提辖。后来杭州知府是太师蔡京的儿子蔡鋆，虐政殃民，人称蔡鋆为“蔡虎”。武松对这个奸臣恨之入骨，决心为民除害。他身藏利刃，隐匿在蔡府之前，刺杀了蔡鋆，但被官兵捕获，惨死于狱中。&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;There was such a Wu Song in recorded history. He was originally a roaming bard, who once worked for the Hangzhou magistrate office. The Hangzhou magistrate was replaced with Cai Yun, the son of the Prime Minister Cai Jing. He was a tyrant who abused his people, and was given the nickname Cai &quot;Tiger&quot;. Wu Song hated this evil official, and decided to assassinate him. He carried a blade and hid at the door of the Cai residence, successfully assassinating Cai Yun. However, he was captured by soldiers and died in prison. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A combination of both theories, either or neither could be correct. I was unable to find more definitive primary sources, but again Chinese academic sources on ancient literature is much more difficult to find online than English literature academic sources, even when searching in Chinese. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.chinesekungfu.com.cn/html/1312/db1b74ea-6519-4c23-bb84-6c4c98a29b95.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_551640e70100sb13.html&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.ycwb.com/ePaper/ycwb/html/2013-05/16/content_156826.htm?div=-1&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263724/unable-to-post-chinese-character-due-to-malfunctioning-validation-filter" />

I agree with Jeffrey Tigay (p. 42) that there was a single creative mind behind the Old Babylonian, Akkadian text, who deserves to be viewed as an author, not simply as a complier or editor of earlier textual sources and myths. From this perspective, looking at the background of other myths is necessary and helpful, but we know that creative authors do change earlier material around for their own purposes, so in the end we must figure out the authorial intent. Since the earlier answer has already covered the Sumerian general background well, I’ll not dwell on that myself but focus on authorial intent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, however, I should mention that the Sumerian myth *Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven* (see on [ETCSL][1]) is fairly relevant here. In that story Inanna is upset at Gilgamesh because he seems to want to usurp her ceremonial functions at the Eanna temple (and also spend too much time hunting in the wilds), and so she sends the Bull of Heaven after him, which he and Enkidu kill as in the Gilgamesh epic. Unlike in the Gilgamesh epic, here there is nothing about Gilgamesh rejecting the goddess as a lover (it appears at the beginning of the myth that they already have been lovers), but like in the Gilgamesh epic this myth does show Gilgamesh as having an overweening pride and disrespect for the goddess, which is what gets him into trouble, so this hubris motif is consistent as between the two stories. I don’t think that the Sumerian background generally portrays Inanna (later Ishtar) and Gilgamesh as eternal enemies, which would be unimaginable for this king of Uruk where Inanna had her Eanna temple as tutelary deity of the city he ruled (meaning that as king he may have annually undertaken a sacred marriage ritual with her). In another Sumerian myth known as The Huluppu Tree, it is Gilgamesh who is Inanna’s hero and benefactor. There he chased a serpent, the Anzu-bird, and Lilith away from Inanna’s sacred tree in her garden after her own brother Utu had ignored her entreaties and refused to do so. Gilgamesh came to her rescue, and then fashioned parts of the tree into gifts for her. It is possible that in the aftermath they became lovers. Thus, I think the cause of their spat in the Gilgamesh epic is particular to this story, which gets us back to what its author was up to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a literary standpoint, I think Gilgamesh’s encounter with Ishtar in the epic should be considered against Enkidu’s earlier sexual encounter with the cult courtesan Shamhat, from whom he gains wisdom and becomes civilized. Gilgamesh, on the other hand, already has this knowledge and a high degree of wisdom when he confronts Ishtar. But here he is too smart and knowledgeable for his own good. So when Ishtar makes her advances, he calls up the litany of her failed relationships with other lovers and says he wants no part of that. But he goes on and on about it in a prideful way and is really insulting to Ishtar, something that a human (or demigod like Gilgamesh) should never do to. This is a display of hubris, which explains the long litany. If he is to refuse, he should at least do so politely and diplomatically, but he did not apply his wisdom here. Further, humans must stay in their proper place in relation to deities and not rise about their station. Thus, Gilgamesh probably should not have refused at all, and acted according to his station in life. Recall that, as king of Uruk, Gilgamesh probably would have been obligated to undertake annually a sacred marriage ceremony with her, in which case his rejection of her would be an improper dereliction of duty in violation of the established cosmic order.  His and Enkidu’s pride brings on the onslaught of the Bull of Heaven, where they display even more hubris, Enkidu by throwing the haunch of the dismembered Bull at Ishtar. This sets up the real punishment. Gilgamesh instead of Enkidu could have perished in response to vanquishing the Bull, but the gods decide that Enkidu should die. Nevertheless, Gilgamesh suffers greatly by reason of Enkidu’s death, which is necessary for the plot because this is what gets him thinking about immortality and sets him off on his quest for that.  In that quest he displays more pride and ambition, but in the end he has to be reconciled with human life and his fate as it is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, Ishtar too is being portrayed negatively here. From her own behavior (e.g., she does the proposing) and what Gilgamesh describes about her in the litany, it becomes clear that she is acting badly, in fact much like a man, so it is understandable why Gilgamesh rejects her. Contrast this with the story’s favorable portrayals of Shamhat and Siduri, who reflect more traditional feminine profiles favored by the author.

I agree with Jeffrey Tigay (p. 42) that there was a single creative mind behind the Old Babylonian, Akkadian text, who deserves to be viewed as an author, not simply as a complier or editor of earlier textual sources and myths. From this perspective, looking at the background of other myths is necessary and helpful, but we know that creative authors do change earlier material around for their own purposes, so in the end we must figure out the authorial intent. Since the earlier answer has already covered the Sumerian general background well, I’ll not dwell on that myself but focus on authorial intent. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Having said that, however, I should mention that the Sumerian myth *Gilgamesh and the Bull of Heaven* (see on [ETCSL][1]) is fairly relevant here. In that story Inanna is upset at Gilgamesh because he seems to want to usurp her ceremonial functions at the Eanna temple (and also spend too much time hunting in the wilds), and so she sends the Bull of Heaven after him, which he and Enkidu kill as in the Gilgamesh epic. Unlike in the Gilgamesh epic, here there is nothing about Gilgamesh rejecting the goddess as a lover (it appears at the beginning of the myth that they already have been lovers), but like in the Gilgamesh epic this myth does show Gilgamesh as having an overweening pride and disrespect for the goddess, which is what gets him into trouble, so this hubris motif is consistent as between the two stories. I don’t think that the Sumerian background generally portrays Inanna (later Ishtar) and Gilgamesh as eternal enemies, which would be unimaginable for this king of Uruk where Inanna had her Eanna temple as tutelary deity of the city he ruled (meaning that as king he may have annually undertaken a sacred marriage ritual with her). In another Sumerian myth known as The Huluppu Tree, it is Gilgamesh who is Inanna’s hero and benefactor. There he chased a serpent, the Anzu-bird, and Lilith away from Inanna’s sacred tree in her garden after her own brother Utu had ignored her entreaties and refused to do so. Gilgamesh came to her rescue, and then fashioned parts of the tree into gifts for her. It is possible that in the aftermath they became lovers. Thus, I think the cause of their spat in the Gilgamesh epic is particular to this story, which gets us back to what its author was up to.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;From a literary standpoint, I think Gilgamesh’s encounter with Ishtar in the epic should be considered against Enkidu’s earlier sexual encounter with the cult courtesan Shamhat, from whom he gains wisdom and becomes civilized. Gilgamesh, on the other hand, already has this knowledge and a high degree of wisdom when he confronts Ishtar. But here he is too smart and knowledgeable for his own good. So when Ishtar makes her advances, he calls up the litany of her failed relationships with other lovers and says he wants no part of that. But he goes on and on about it in a prideful way and is really insulting to Ishtar, something that a human (or demigod like Gilgamesh) should never do to. This is a display of hubris, which explains the long litany. If he is to refuse, he should at least do so politely and diplomatically, but he did not apply his wisdom here. Further, humans must stay in their proper place in relation to deities and not rise about their station. Thus, Gilgamesh probably should not have refused at all, and acted according to his station in life. Recall that, as king of Uruk, Gilgamesh probably would have been obligated to undertake annually a sacred marriage ceremony with her, in which case his rejection of her would be an improper dereliction of duty in violation of the established cosmic order.  His and Enkidu’s pride brings on the onslaught of the Bull of Heaven, where they display even more hubris, Enkidu by throwing the haunch of the dismembered Bull at Ishtar. This sets up the real punishment. Gilgamesh instead of Enkidu could have perished in response to vanquishing the Bull, but the gods decide that Enkidu should die. Nevertheless, Gilgamesh suffers greatly by reason of Enkidu’s death, which is necessary for the plot because this is what gets him thinking about immortality and sets him off on his quest for that.  In that quest he displays more pride and ambition, but in the end he has to be reconciled with human life and his fate as it is. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On the other hand, Ishtar too is being portrayed negatively here. From her own behavior (e.g., she does the proposing) and what Gilgamesh describes about her in the litany, it becomes clear that she is acting badly, in fact much like a man, so it is understandable why Gilgamesh rejects her. Contrast this with the story’s favorable portrayals of Shamhat and Siduri, who reflect more traditional feminine profiles favored by the author.  Thus, both Ishtar and Gilgamesh are aspiring to go beyond their proper stations, as a result of which each of their expected roles has become inverted to some extent: Gilgamesh attempting to become divine rather than living as a man, and the goddess acting like a man rather than serving in a more conventional female role. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Sources:**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dalley, Stephanie. *Myths from Mesopotamia.* Oxford: Oxford University Press. 1989.

However, the meaning of this varies between characters. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In some instances, having multiple pupils is a sign that the character has an &quot;evil eye.&quot; For example, in the Togail Bruidne Da Derga (The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel), a character with multiple pupils causes a juggler to drop his objects:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; A man ungentle, huge, fearful, uncouth was Ingcél. A single eye in his head, as broad as an oxhide, as black as a chafer, with three pupils therein.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; When he was swiftest, I beheld him at the feat, and as I looked, they uttered a cry about him and they were all on the house-floor. Then the Prince who is in the house said to the juggler: ‘We have come together since thou wast a little boy, and till to-night thy juggling never failed thee.’’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; ‘Alas, alas, fair master Conaire, good cause have I. A keen, angry eye looked at me: a man with the third of a pupil which sees the going of the nine bands. Not much to him is that keen, wrathful sight! Battles are fought with it,’ saith he. ‘It should be known till doomsday that there is evil in front of the Hostel.’&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Online translation of The Destruction of Da Derga's Hostel][1])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, in works like the Táin Bó Cúalnge, having multiple pupils can be a sign of beauty or supernatural sight (or both). To quote from this fantastic paper titled ['The Evil Eye' in early Irish literature and law][2] (which is essentially the source for this entire answer):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The version that Ingcél has seven pupils in his eye has a parallel&#xD;&#xA;in descriptions of Cormac mac Airt and Cú Chulainn: they are&#xD;&#xA;said to have seven pupils in each eye. In both cases, this is explictly&#xD;&#xA;qualified as a sign of beauty. In Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension I, two of&#xD;&#xA;Cú Chulainn’s pupils are described as squinting, but the text supplies the&#xD;&#xA;comment that this was more an adornment than a disfigurement. The&#xD;&#xA;tradition of three pupils in Ingcél’s eye could be compared with another&#xD;&#xA;instance in Táin Bó Cúailnge Recension I: after the description of the&#xD;&#xA;poetess and prophetess Fedelm as a beautiful woman, it is said that she&#xD;&#xA;carries a weaver’s beam and has three pupils in each eye. There is no&#xD;&#xA;explanation offered of this characteristic: it could be a sign of beauty&#xD;&#xA;and it could be a sign of her supernatural sight. The latter is more&#xD;&#xA;probable, because the characteristic is separated from the description of&#xD;&#xA;her looks by the mention of the weaver’s beam. The weaver’s beam has&#xD;&#xA;been interpreted as a supernatural tool for prophesy. The triple pupils&#xD;&#xA;could, therefore, very well be a symbol of her clairvoyance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(Borsje, Jacqueline; Kelly, Fergus: ['The evil eye' in early Irish literature and law.][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In summery, depending on the character and story, having multiple pupils is associated with (rarely) beauty, sharp site (i.e. clairvoyance), or destruction (i.e. &quot;the evil eye&quot;). However, I think you can connect those &quot;symptoms&quot; back to the evil eye; for example, being able to see the future/see well is one of the characteristics of having the evil eye, although in the Táin it's portrayed more positively. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you're interested in learning more, I highly recommend that you take a look at [the paper I cited about the evil eye][2]: it's very interesting and connects the phenomenon to Irish law and a variety of non-Irish texts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/T301017A.html&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://bill.celt.dias.ie/vol4/displayObject.php?TreeID=1001" />

The biggest difference here is that Odin did not sacrifice his life, but other things. His eye to Mimir's well for wisdom, for one. The sacrifice for obtaining the runes is more complex, but still applicable in its parallels, I think:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,&#xD;&#xA;nine whole nights,&#xD;&#xA;with a spear wounded, and to Odin offered,&#xD;&#xA;myself to myself;&#xD;&#xA;on that tree, of which no one knows&#xD;&#xA;from what root it springs.&#xD;&#xA;Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,&#xD;&#xA;downward I peered,&#xD;&#xA;to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,&#xD;&#xA;then fell down thence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Havamal][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both events took place in locations other than Midgard, and the sacrifice on the tree has a number of parallels to Jesus' crucifixion (spear wound in the side, lack of food and water, hanging from a tree or wood).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whether you want to say that the Germanic mythology influenced the Christian one, or the other way around, it's pretty clear that there is precedent of sacrificial cycles occurring in a non-Earth realm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html#runes" />

The sacrifice for obtaining the runes is more complex, but still applicable in its parallels, I think:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; I know that I hung on a wind-rocked tree,&#xD;&#xA;nine whole nights,&#xD;&#xA;with a spear wounded, and to Odin offered,&#xD;&#xA;myself to myself;&#xD;&#xA;on that tree, of which no one knows&#xD;&#xA;from what root it springs.&#xD;&#xA;Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink,&#xD;&#xA;downward I peered,&#xD;&#xA;to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them,&#xD;&#xA;then fell down thence&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Havamal][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Both events took place in locations other than Midgard, and the sacrifice on the tree has a number of parallels to Jesus' crucifixion (spear wound in the side, lack of food and water, hanging from a tree or wood).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Whether you want to say that the Germanic mythology influenced the Christian one, or the other way around, it's pretty clear that there is precedent of sacrificial cycles occurring in a non-Earth realm.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**But These Were Recorded In The 12th Century**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;They weren't *written down* until 12th century, true, but the Germanic tribes were a strong oral culture, not unlike the Jews were before the books of the Bible were written down.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So how would the Jews and the Germanic people interact? Simply put, via the Romans.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Romans were spread far and wide. The Roman Empire, itself, spread into what is now Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the entire northern coast of Africa. Combine that with the Silk Road trade route, and they were mixing cultural aspects from as far east as China with that of the Gauls from England. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Romans and Germanics were not strangers, by any stretch, and the Germanic tribes were well-documented by the Romans, including Julius Cesaer and Senator Tacitus. Tacitus even illustrates in *Germania* that several of the southernmost Germanic tribes were part of the Roman Empire (and the Roman Republic before it), [among other details][3] about them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Romans, even long before the Empire, were equal-opportunity slavers, bringing slaves in from all corners of their reach. Combined with the [Jewish Encyclopedia's attestation][4] that the Jews had been in Rome since at least as early as the 100s BCE, it makes at least some contact between the Germanics and the Jews rather likely. Start combining stories of Baldr and Forseti with those of Jesus, and you start seeing both the Earthly Jesus story (Forseti's &quot;12+1&quot; motif) and the Heavenly Jesus sacrifice/resurrection (Baldr's sacrifice/resurrection motif). With the propensity of Earthly sacrificial gods, though ([Horus, Mithra, Osiris, etc.][5]), it's easy to see why the Earthly Jesus story won out in the canon.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other Early Influence**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think most notably, the Canaanites' religion -- specifically Ba'al -- had some of the heaviest influence with regard to a death/resurrection deity. Hell, Ba'al is mentioned in several passages of the Bible, itself, as basically an example of &quot;who not to worship,&quot; and the Bible goes to great lengths to make Ba'al out to be supremely evil. This (along with various other knowledge of the fluidity of religion around that time) suggests to me that worship or otherwise acknowledgement of Ba'al may have had more influence than a Greek or Roman counterpart (which, it seems, the Jews actively resisted as they resisted assimilation into the Roman culture in general). The story of [Ahab in 1 Kings][6] is a prime example of this issue.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[Ba'al is attested][7] to be the son of another deity (usually attested as El, though Dagon is a close contender), though is the principal god of the Canaanites. He basically represented life in pretty much all its aspects -- fertility, rain, the sun, the cycle of the year. He, himself, died and was reborn every year (presumably in the Canaanites' version of heaven or non-earthly plane).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**But Christianity Doesn't Have That Kind Of Cyclical Nature**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;You may be thinking that the cyclical nature rules them out as influences on the Jesus story. I disagree. For one, Jedeo-Christianity does actually have a cyclical nature to it, it just happens that the cycles tend to be quite a bit longer -- in multiples of 7. The most common, of course, is the week, but year-length ones exist, too. Every 7th year is a sabbatical year, every 7th sabbatical year (well, technically, the year after, since that year is the sabbatical, and like the Sabbath day, it's pretty much required to rest, so every 50th year; at least, that's how I understand it, but I'm not a Jewish scholar) is a Jubilee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The lengths of these cycles seem to hold up with Judeo-Christian lore, as they [seem to line up with times of prosperity or distress among the Israelites or prominent Biblical figures][8], though often on timelines of several centuries (basically, they faced Jehovah's wrath if they missed too many Sabbatical years, or worse, too many Jubilees). In the case of Jeremiah, it was a 70 year punishment after 490 years of the Israelites not obeying the Sabbath years. It was also not uncommon for punishments to be laid out over the course of a generation or more (the Israelites lost in the desert for 40 years, for example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Likewise, the prophecy of Daniel about the rebuilding of Jerusalem is 1000 years in length, as is the reign of Jesus after the Second Coming and Tribulation period, further lending to very long cycle lengths. In other words, it's not that there's no cycle, it's just that the cycles in Judeo-Christianity are *really long*, so we only see information about a couple completed regarding Jesus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/pre/pre04.htm&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/havamal.html#runes&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~wstevens/history331texts/barbarians.html&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12816-rome#1005&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://www.liberalamerica.org/2015/03/17/5-near-identical-jesus-christ-myths-that-predate-jesus/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kings%2016&#xD;&#xA;  [7]: http://www.pantheon.org/articles/b/baal.html&#xD;&#xA;  [8]: http://www.1260-1290-days-bible-prophecy.org/Jubilee-missing-Sabbaths.htm" />

While not sacrificed, he was slain and is said to be reborn after Ragnarok. Often being associated with light and purity, he is very often drawn as a Christ parallel. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In fact, [*Gylfaginning* has this to say of Baldr][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The second son of Odin is Baldur, and good things are to be said of him. He is best, and all praise him; he is so fair of feature, and so bright, that light shines from him. A certain herb is so white that it is likened to Baldr's brow; of all grasses it is whitest, and by it thou mayest judge his fairness, both in hair and in body. He is the wisest of the Æsir, and the fairest-spoken and most gracious; and that quality attends him, that none may gainsay his judgments.

Tacitus even illustrates in *Germania* that several of the southernmost Germanic tribes were part of the Roman Empire (and the Roman Republic before it), [among other details][3] about them. Additionally, the Roman army under Gaius Marius captured some 20,000 Teutons at their final defeat in France in 100BC in the Cimbrian War, [many of which went on to fight in the Third Servile War.][4] &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Romans, even long before the Empire, were equal-opportunity slavers, bringing slaves in from all corners of their reach. Furthermore, the Romans *intentionally* mixed ethnic groups as a means of preventing solidarity, because they were fully aware of both the tensions between the non-Roman tribes and the ramifications of the slaves forming an army (particularly when headed by trained and tested gladiators). Combined with the [Jewish Encyclopedia's attestation][5] that the Jews had been in Rome since at least as early as the 100s BCE, it makes at least some contact between the Germanics and the Jews rather likely. Start combining stories of Baldr and Forseti with those of Jesus, and you start seeing both the Earthly Jesus story (Forseti's &quot;12+1&quot; motif) and the Heavenly Jesus sacrifice/resurrection (Baldr's sacrifice/resurrection motif).

Recent findings have shown that they [had direct contact with the Arabian nations][7]. This particular contact was a later dating, but says that the Germanic people were no stranger to the Arabians. Interestingly, while the Germanics' hostile movements were more westward, toward France and Spain, the known contacts with Arabian people were largely peaceful -- missions of trade instead of invasion (possibly for metals of various sorts, including silver and iron, due to [the relative scarcity of such minerals in the northern parts of Germania][8]).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**Other Early Influence**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think most notably, the Canaanites' religion -- specifically Ba'al -- had some of the heaviest influence with regard to a death/resurrection deity.

It was also not uncommon for punishments to be laid out over the course of a generation or more (the Israelites lost in the desert for 40 years, for example).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Likewise, the prophecy of Daniel about the rebuilding of Jerusalem is 1000 years in length, as is the reign of Jesus after the Second Coming and Tribulation period, further lending to very long cycle lengths.

As [Simon explained in the comments][1], serpents feature prominently in many non-western mythologies:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; In Australia the Aboriginals believe that a Rainbow Serpent created the landscape, embodied the spirit of the fresh water and punished lawbreakers. In Cambodian Mythology, they believe the Khmer People to have been born out of union of Indian and Nagas or Serpents. For Hindus it represents rebirth due to the casting off of it's skin and being 'reborn'. Search for Nāgas for more Hindu myths, they feature prominently in several myths. Koreans fear the snake and worship it as a god. In Mesoamerica we have Quetzalcoatl who was a 'feathered serpent' patron of arts, crafts and merchants.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Why is this? To answer that question, I'm going to take a look at the epic of Gilgamesh, which is from a similar region as the bible. Here's a description of a snake from the epic:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 'This plant, Ur-shanabi, is the &quot;Plant of Heartbeat&quot;,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; with it a man can regain his vigour.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; To Uruk-the-Sheepfold 1 will take it,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; to an ancient will feed some and put the plant to the test! &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; 'Its name shall be &quot;Old Man Grown Young&quot;,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; I will eat it myself, and be again as I was in my youth!'   &#xD;&#xA;&gt; At twenty leagues they broke bread,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; at thirty leagues they stopped for the night.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Gilgamesh found a pool whose water was cool,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; down he went into it, to bathe in the water.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Of the plant's fragrance a snake caught scent,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; came up [in silence], and bore the plant off.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; As it turned away it sloughed its skin.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; Then Gilgamesh sat down and wept, &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Epic of Gilgamesh][2])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To summarize: Gilgamesh has a plant that grants him immortality, but the plant is taken from him by a snake. The snake then becomes immortal, as snakes can &quot;shed their skin&quot; and thus be reborn. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm not trying to suggest that Gilgamesh is a precursor to the bible, or that Gilgamesh represents every other myth that features serpents, but it is illuminating as an example of how other cultures viewed serpents. It's clear from the epic of Gilgamesh that snakes are strongly associated with rebirth, immortality, and life. I hope that goes some way towards explaining why serpents aren't portrayed as &quot;evil&quot; in other cultures.&#xD;&#xA; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://mythology.stackexchange.com/questions/1099/why-do-several-myths-portray-snakes-as-good-things#comment3687_1099&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.cidmod.org/sidurisadvice/Gilgamesh.pdf" />

Remember that Grendel is a coward (he attacks at night, etc.), and would want to avoid a fight with Beowolf if at all possible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;For example, when Grendel enters the hall, he get's extremely excited when he sees the armed warriors sleeping there, and decides to eat them all up. This will allow Beowolf to surprise him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Strode he angrily; from the eyes of him glimmered  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A lustre unlovely likest to fire.  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; He beheld in the hall the heroes in numbers,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A circle of kinsmen sleeping together,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; **He exults over his supposed prey.**  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; A throng of thanemen: then his thoughts were exultant,  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; He minded to sunder from each of the thanemen  &#xD;&#xA;&gt; The life from his body  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Unfortunately for him, Beowolf is hiding in the crowd, and is able to catch Grendel by surprise:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Nearer he strode then, the stout-hearted warrior  &#xD;&#xA;Snatched as he slumbered, seizing with hand-grip,  &#xD;&#xA;Forward the foeman foined with his hand;  &#xD;&#xA;Caught he quickly the cunning deviser,  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The text also tells us that it is necessary for Beowolf to surprise Grendel, because the moment Grendel learns of the strength of Beowolf he wants to flee:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Fearful in spirit, faint-mooded waxed he,  &#xD;&#xA;Not off could betake him; death he was pondering,  &#xD;&#xA;Would fly to his covert, seek the devils’ assembly:  &#xD;&#xA;His calling no more was the same he had followed  &#xD;&#xA;Long in his lifetime.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The *second* reason is that there is a specific symbolic meaning attached to the idea of fighting Grendel without swords and armor. In this case, using swords and/or armor has an element both of pride/hubris (you believe that superior weapons can overcome a supernatural being who uses none) and an element of cowardice (you are afraid to face Grendel on your own without weapons). The use of weapons by Beowolf's companions serves as a contrast between them and Beowolf himself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(I'm basing my interpretations solely on the text because I don't have time to research how critics or academics interpret this scene. However, I believe that I've done sufficient research to answer the question. All quotations from Beowolf are from the translation cited in the question.)" />

Once something gets into the popular imagination, it's difficult to leave. Just look at the featherless, fatless dinosaurs in Jurassic World.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Apart from the visual aspect, &quot;Pandora's box&quot; has now become a saying, and saying's are notoriously difficult to change, [even when wrong](https://books.google.com/books?id=Lev7YeUk7H0C&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, though, the type of jar mentioned, a *pithos*, is meant for storage, and is often plugged up with cork and wax. However, the action of snapping the lid quickly doesn't exist for a pithos, so when recalling the memory of the story, the vivid actions tend to override the more inconsequential details, leaving the incorrect details in the retelling. From there, it's a simple snowball effect.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*The Adages of Erasmus*, ed. by William W.

This is a fact. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The google document (why didn't you just link to the wikipedia page that the google document is copied from?) is a copy of [the wikipedia page for the movie The Last Legion][2]. This movie is &quot;a 2007 Fantasy film&quot; that combines Arthurian legend with roman history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. You say that `&quot;Some say that it was based in Rome and Merlin first possessed the sword given and made for Caesar Augustus, who ruled in Rome in 27 BC until 14 AD. Passing down the sword to each generation eventually being thrown into a stone that only a true Caesar could pull out.&quot;` *That is only true in the movie The Last Legion*, which, as stated previously, is a work of fantasy. This is not actual history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The legend of the sword in the stone, minus the stuff about Caesar Augustus (which, as stated previously, is from the movie The Last Legion), is from [Arthurian legend][1].  T.H. White is the author of [a children's book][3], which is *also* based on Arthurian legend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The legend of the sword and the stone is a component of Arthurian legend. Arthurian legend is a collection of old stories about King Arthur. A common feature in many of those stories is the mini-story of the &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot;, which features King Arthur pulling a sword out of a stone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------------------------------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The actual answer to the question:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;  The first reference to the sword in the stone is to be found only in the prose redaction of Robert de Boron’s *Merlin*. Of the original poem only some five hundred lines survive.Considering that, and the way scribes could elaborate on their sources, we can not now be sure whether the sword in the stone featured in Robert’s own work or not. Whichever is the case, the work does predate the Vulgate Cycle and the other prose works important to this discussion. Before going on we should therefore be clear just what the sword in the stone was, and was not, as it was first presented.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Toohey, Kathleen, King Arthur's Swords][4])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anyone is interested, you can [read the Prose Merlin online][5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have not found any *historical* reference to anyone pulling out a sword from a stone. I think this makes sense, because I imagine that it would be hard to put a sword there in the first place.

[Sargon of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad), based in Akkad in now northern Iraq, would boast of his conquests of the far reaches of Mesopotamia, including the cedar forests:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He made them cross the Amanus; he made his troops cross the Amanus. He reached the cedar forest. Amidst its din(?) he bowed down and readied his weapons. He offered a sacrifice, made obeisance, spoke distinctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(&quot;Sargon in Foreign Lands,&quot; vv. 11'-14')&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This particular text comes from an epic of Sargon, although the fragmentary nature of it makes it difficult to know the full extent of the composition. What we do know is that there are many parallels with the Gilgamesh story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Sargonic dynasty (ca. 2300-2150) was the first real empire (now often called the Akkadian empire), and Sargon's and his descedants' rule, though they were of a Semitic-speaking people (usually called Assyrian or Babylonian based off the primacy of those two cities in latter times), included all of Sumer, a different people with a different language. After its collapse, the city of Ur took over the empire (although lacked its far reaches), which is now known as the Ur III dynasty. Ur was not a Semitic city, but a Sumerian one, and so naturally there was some tension in recognizing Sargon's deeds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the results of this tension appears to be the ascription of deeds of Sargon to Gilgamesh. Since Sargon went to Dilmun, Gilgamesh went to Dilmun; since Sargon conquered the area containing cedar forests, so too did Gilgamesh go to the Cedar Forest and defeat Humbaba.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The precise relationship between the two is hypothetical. One hypothesis is that the journey to Cedar Forests was only created in the Ur III period. The epic would act as a counter of sorts to the Akkadian propaganda that preceded it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An alternative, one favored by Tigay (p. 78), is that there was always a journey to the Cedar Forest, but only with the Akkadian period did it acquire a precise location corresponding with Sargon's military activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hansman 1976. &quot;Gilgamesh, Humbaba and the Land of the Erin-Trees.&quot; *Iraq* 38.1: 23–35.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Horowitz 1988. *Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography*.

In fact, scholars have a couple theories on this. According to the standard interpretation, the cedar forests refer to the famous cedar forests of Lebanon and Syria, which were highly sought after by kings as far back as Sargon. [Sargon of Akkad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_of_Akkad), based in Akkad in now northern Iraq, would boast of his conquests of the far reaches of Mesopotamia, including the cedar forests:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; He made them cross the Amanus; he made his troops cross the Amanus. He reached the cedar forest. Amidst its din(?) he bowed down and readied his weapons. He offered a sacrifice, made obeisance, spoke distinctly.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(&quot;Sargon in Foreign Lands,&quot; vv. 11'-14')&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There were not many forests with in either Mesopotamia or Egypt with the quality of wood you could find in Syria and the Levant, so timber from the region was extremely important. The acquisition of a source of cheap timber would most certainly be connected with issues of imperial expansion, and it's no surprise that both Pharaonic Egypt and Mesopotamia as early as Sargon of Akkad both desired control over the region.[[1]](http://dendro.cornell.edu/articles/kuniholm1997b.pdf) (warning: PDF)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This particular text comes from an epic of Sargon, although the fragmentary nature of it makes it difficult to know the full extent of the composition. What we do know is that there are many parallels with the Gilgamesh story.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The Sargonid dynasty (ca. 2300-2150) was the first real empire (now often called the Akkadian empire), and Sargon and his descendants' rule, though they were of a Semitic-speaking people (usually called Assyrian or Babylonian based off the primacy of those two cities in latter times), included all of Sumer, a different people with a different language. After its collapse, the city of Ur took over the empire (although lacked its far reaches), which is now known as the Ur III dynasty. Ur was not a Semitic city, but a Sumerian one, and so naturally there was some tension in recognizing Sargon's deeds.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;One of the results of this tension appears to be the ascription of deeds of Sargon to Gilgamesh. Since Sargon went to Dilmun, Gilgamesh went to Dilmun; since Sargon conquered the area containing cedar forests, so too did Gilgamesh go to the Cedar Forest and defeat Humbaba.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The precise relationship between the two is hypothetical. One hypothesis is that the journey to Cedar Forests was only created in the Ur III period. The epic would act as a counter of sorts to the Akkadian propaganda that preceded it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An alternative, one favored by Tigay (p. 78), is that there was always a journey to the Cedar Forest, but only with the Akkadian period did it acquire a precise location corresponding with Sargon's military activity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sources:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Hansman 1976. &quot;Gilgamesh, Humbaba and the Land of the Erin-Trees.&quot; *Iraq* 38.1: 23–35.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Horowitz 1988. *Mesopotamian Cosmic Geography*.

The reading is: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&gt; **Volturnalia a deo Volturno, cuius feriae tum. Octobri mense** Meditrinalia dies dictus a medendo, quod Flaccus flamen Martialis dicebat hoc die solitum vinum novum et vetus libari...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'll use the [Loeb translation](https://archive.org/stream/onlatinlanguage01varruoft#page/194/mode/2up) with some clarifications:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;&gt; [There's also the] Volturnalia, from the god Volturnus, whose festival was at that time. In the month of October [was] the Meditrinalia, [which] was named from *mederi* [&quot;to be healed&quot;] because Flaccus the Flamen Martialis [a type of priest of Mars] used to say that on this day it was the practice to pour an offering of new and old wine to the god...&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The very bad scholarship took the meaning of &quot;tum&quot; (at that time) to mean in the month of October, but the language wouldn't work like that. Instead, it would refer backwards, and the preceding passage discusses a festival in August. So the Volturnalia is in August.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Some have taken the god Volturnus to be the same as Vertumnus, but this is actually just a guess. We don't know who exactly Volturnus is. It's possible they're the same, one being pronounced similar to the original Etruscan and one being more Romanized, but again, this is hypothetical.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So the whole Pomona = 31 Oct? That's just bad scholarship that got passed along to non-Classicists writing about Halloween. There's no relationship.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Interestingly, Scullard doesn't mention the festival of Pomona, nor does Beard/North/Price. It is true that Pomona is the consort of Vertumnus, but I'm not seeing anything that's expressly saying she shared part in his worship on Vertumnus, though it's likely that it was the case." />

This is likely because Kronos 'begat' the Olympian generation, and therefore was the 'seed'.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Saying the Greeks viewed Kronos as evil is something of a simplification, and it's important to recognize it as such because the difference in Greek and Roman religious worldviews goes to the heart of your question. For the Greeks, the gods showed supernatural virtue **and** supernatural vice. As can be deduced from his name, Kronos was originally an agricultural deity and the connection of seeds to planting and harvesting crops led to an association with seasons. Kronos wasn't necessarily *evil*, it rather might be more diplomatic to say that because he feared one of his children would overthrow him (a well-founded fear, it turns out) he was doing 'what he had to do' by eating them.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Saturn's etymology is a bit trickier, but is probably PIE * *sewH(r)-* which would have meant 'seed, bring forth' and is cognate with modern English seed, son, semen, serum, sow (meaning what you do with seeds in a field). This means Saturn for the oldest of the Romans had an agricultural character (like Kronos for the Greeks) and it is apparent the two entities come from a single concept in an earlier PIE society.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The big difference is for the Romans the gods were paragons of virtue **or** vice. They were individuals much more to be beheld from afar with a sense of fear or awe; the Greek gods were extraordinarily relatable by comparison. The Roman association of agrarian wealth with Saturn was therefore the chief issue for *people*, while the conflict between himself and Jupiter was a matter amongst the gods. The Greeks didn't view the behavior of Kronos and Zeus quite so distantly but rather as a plausible human circumstance, and therefore may have been more reluctant to worship not only someone who ate his children, but who *lost* the war that came after. All fathers worry that their sons will outgrow and eventually overpower them, and the Titanomachy is a mythical reflection of this universal human process." />

Weimer's answer, so in lieu of that I will expand upon something he said and add a point of my own in the hopes that it's good enough to qualify as a new answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To quote Mr. Weimer:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Others have noted that it may preserve a tradition of backlash against the introduction of agriculture in the region. Abel's offerings would be the offerings of a semi-nomadic shepherd, while Cain's is indicative of a farmer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;*This* is what I've always believed. I was first exposed to this idea in a physical anthropology class in my freshman year, but I didn't register it until reading *Ishmael* by Daniel Quinn. Abel represents pastoralism and Cain is what Quinn calls *totalitarian agriculture*. Note that after being forced to wander, Cain went on to produce children like Enoch and Tubal-Cain who created astronomy, writing, architecture and metalworking. In this way, all of the traditions and practices we would commonly associate with civilization result from agriculture and ultimately from Cain. I think we can see parallels of the theme that conflict involving brothers leads to the beginning of civilization in the Proto-Indo-European divine hero twins * *manu-* (man) and * *yemo-* (twin) cf. Lat. *Gemini*, Skr. *Yama*. Like Romulus and Remus, Cain and Abel, or Ymir in Germanic myths - who was vivisected to constitute the world, the two brothers come to some critical moment and on the death of the twin the survivor (the elder brother) - or his progeny - goes on to found advanced societies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, I'd like to suggest an uncommon and somewhat apologist reading of the text in Genesis 4 whereby Cain is obeying God by killing Abel because the act essentially amounts to a sacrifice. The Lord looked favorably on Abel for his offering but unfavorably on Cain for his own. The Lord then tells Cain 'Do not just be angry. Do what is right (make an appropriate offering) and you(r sacrifice) will be accepted.' In Cain going on to sacrifice his brother, the 'sweetest of his bounty', I would argue we are seeing an early iteration of later stories, for example Abraham being asked to sacrifice his son, whereby the Lord is only satiated with the blood of his servants' beloveds. Looked at this way, Cain is the first killer but not the first *murderer*, and a conflicted character whose adherence to duty drives his hand.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheers!" />

I put kingship in quotes because it's something of a standing question whether or not PIE speakers even had such a concept. 'Having the right to rule' may be a better way of describing this function. In line with C.M. Weimer's comments above, in the paper Komita argues Poseidon is a specially-adapted form of the Sky Father (i.e. Zeus) as evidenced by Poseidon's trident as compared to Zeus's lightning bolt and Poseidon's conflict with Athena over patronage of cities - on the notion that the horse god's blessing was necessary to legitimately rule.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;**edit**: I originally got the name of this paper from the Wikipedia article, to tell the truth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BzP6osk7T7shYVI2VmtGUDBBVm8 &quot;this short, accessible paper&quot;" />

But various other sources say it was really an element of the festival of her consort, the god Vertumnus, whose festival, the Vertumnalia, was in August (the 13th) (H.H. Scullard, Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic (1981), pp. 174-75). &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only explanation I've come across for the discrepancy so far is in the Italian Wikipedia article on the Vertumnalia, which says the mistake of dating the Vertumnalia in (late) October is due to a misinterpretation of a passage in Varro Reatinus (De Lingua Latina, 6.20-21). Ovid talks about both deities but sheds no light on the dating. Does anyone have a more thorough explanation based on original or scholarly sources?" />

There are, of course, the famous examples of Odin and Balder in Scandinavian mythology. Some would say that the Odin myth shows Christian influence, but that's begging the question: it starts with the assumption that the Scandinavians could not have their own indigenous dying-and-rising-god myth and argues from there that the myth must be influenced by Christianity. Such arguments are not very convincing.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another example that hardly anyone ever brings up is the Hindu god Ganesha. Shiva actually cuts off his head, killing him, and then, when faced with an irate Parvati, Shiva's wife and Ganesha's mother, he replaces the severed head with an elephant's and brings Ganesha back to life. That is a clear-cut case of dying-and-rising god if ever there was one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So no, &quot;dying-and-rising gods&quot; are not dead, not by a long shot, and in fact are not as geographically limited as commonly supposed. The myths don't have to be uniform. They just have to share the features of death and resurrection, either explicitly or symbolically, as a journey to the underworld followed by a return or rescue to the world of the living.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I can't speak to current scholarly fashions; it may be *du jour* to express skepticism about the validity of mythological archetypes. But though specialists always insist on the significance of atomistic details, they can't diminish the importance of unifying themes. It seems this one is due for a resurrection." />

This storey came to us from Plutarch, who writes that:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This ships is identified as the one that Ancient Athens used to send to Delos to honour Apollo. That story is preserved by Plato, who explains:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The stern of the ship which the Athenians sent to Delos happened to have been crowned on the day before he was tried ... It is the ship in which, according to Athenian tradition, Theseus went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was the saviour of them and of himself. And they are said to have vowed to Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would send a yearly mission to Delos. Now this custom still continues, and the whole period of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No name has been attributed to the ship in either account.

And this apparently suited Tolkien.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There is a remarkable, broad swath of shared belief systems in Northern Europe that extends from Ireland, Brittany, and Iceland to Sweden that features supernatural beings that live in communities in social groups reminiscent of those of people. The following is an excerpt from my Introduction to Folklore (2014):&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Supernatural beings living in human-like communities are relatively rare. They occur in the traditions of Polynesia, Britain and Ireland, Scandinavia, Iceland and the North Sea islands, and to a certain extent the Russia. The Celts may have influenced Scandinavian traditions since the two groups had millennia-old contact. In English, the supernatural beings were traditionally called “elves,” but in the Celtic areas they are more typically referred to as “fairies.” In Gaelic, they are the sidhe (pronounced “shee”). The Norwegians call them huldre meaning hidden. In Sweden they are the trolls, but the country is enormous and various locations used different terms. The geographic distribution and history of the word “troll” is extremely complex since it can refer to a wide variety of supernatural beings, depending on the location, and it is sometimes used generically for many types of supernatural beings.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you have further questions, feel free to ask." />

This story came to us from Plutarch, [who writes that][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The ship wherein Theseus and the youth of Athens returned had thirty oars, and was preserved by the Athenians down even to the time of Demetrius Phalereus, for they took away the old planks as they decayed, putting in new and stronger timber in their place, insomuch that this ship became a standing example among the philosophers, for the logical question of things that grow; one side holding that the ship remained the same, and the other contending that it was not the same.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This ships is identified as the one that Ancient Athens used to send to Delos to honour Apollo. That story is preserved by Plato, [who explains][2]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; The stern of the ship which the Athenians sent to Delos happened to have been crowned on the day before he was tried ... It is the ship in which, according to Athenian tradition, Theseus went to Crete when he took with him the fourteen youths, and was the saviour of them and of himself. And they are said to have vowed to Apollo at the time, that if they were saved they would send a yearly mission to Delos. Now this custom still continues, and the whole period of the voyage to and from Delos, beginning when the priest of Apollo crowns the stern of the ship, is a holy season.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No name has been attributed to the ship in either account.

Of the original poem only some five hundred lines survive.Considering that, and the way scribes could elaborate on their sources, we can not now be sure whether the sword in the stone featured in Robert’s own work or not.

This is not actual history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The legend of the sword in the stone, minus the stuff about Caesar Augustus (which, as stated previously, is from the movie The Last Legion), is from [Arthurian legend][1].  T.H.

He wrote long after conversion, and his work was likely affected by the fogging of the lens caused by time and the shift in beliefs caused by the arrival of Christianity. In addition, Snorri's Iceland was far removed from Scandinavia, so anything that one might say about Iceland might not apply to Norway, Denmark, or Sweden, regardless of the period.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Classifying supernatural beings is always problematic since it depends on the fluid testimonies of informants who might not agree with one another and whose observations can change from time to time. Since people might disagree with the use terms and designations, it is absurd to attach too much importance to these sorts of classifications if one is attempting to understand the folk's belief system.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regardless of how Snorri intended his terms of various supernatural beings, his specific categories would probably have meant very little to the folk themselves who would have likely argued with one another about the merits of Snorri's work. We encounter problems with attempts at rigid taxonomy organized by the early folklorists of the nineteenth century. Although their work is of interest and is always a starting point, we generally move past their attempts at classification with an understanding that the folk did not always &quot;follow the rules&quot; established by the early scholars who attempted to understand folk traditions. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In short, I suggest you not over think what Snorri has to say about these categories." />

The  CALLEBURNE was a the lightning-struck sword in the stone.  Until it had been hit by lightning and basically re-forged by the intense heat and electrical current, it was a cheap, plain iron sword.  The moss, rust, and scale had built up on it for years and the bolt from the blue added in some new minerals from the moldstone and coke/charcoal from the lichens growing there: re-making it to fine steel.  Some even say that it was one Merlin's early attempt at sword smithing and that he had abandoned the mold as the sprue of steel had run throughout his mold.&#xD;&#xA;_&#xD;&#xA;Something like this:&quot;Mother nature split the rock from way on high and broke away the Sword from the sprues and the lichen, slime, rust, other bits of dead corruption, and the living vines that had over-grown the mold that had become a Stone (in appearance anyway.) The pelting rain that follows the fireworks quenched the nearly molten steel. And perhaps the celestial arch even rendered lodestone (magnetized) of the blade in the process. As the Ore around the now-separated blade remained energized for hours after the jolt, the Field of current at the precipice of that hill would align every sliver of iron as it cooled with the very energy of all the metals deeply within the earth...  What had been Merlin's last failure as a Blacksmith and a beginning Alchemist had been corrected by the powers of the earth itself.  It is apparent to all that knew; Merlin had never actually been wrong, merely a sign of the impatience of his long-forgotten youth... as he could have certainly re-forged the weapon after that first casting went side-wrong.  He simple moved on to his next pyromancing adventure and experiments with new and better alloys of metal.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;-&#xD;&#xA;As I remember reading it...  It had to be over 30-35 years ago.  It seems to me that it was a collection of Irish Folk tales. Though it may as well have been more generically Gaelic tales that were a combination Welsh, Scottish, Norwegian, Belgian, Bretton, or Burgandy French. It was definitely translated/adapted from a non-english European language tale about the British Isles and a Wizard/Druid.   It was told from the POV of one of Merlin's relatives or at least a Druidic practical follower of the old ways of magic and enlightenment.  +I'll continue.This great sword was stolen from the corrupt regime of Arthur as he grew lax in the enforcement of his codes.  It was sold and cut into two separate swords by an opportunistic blacksmith that could make two fantastic single-sided blades from the double-edged Great Sword wonder.  These monstrosities were returned to Merlin, who re-forged them again back to a whole blade as one of his last acts for King Arthur.  To quench the sword, Merlin flung it into the edge of a lake that was drained by a powerful river; while the tip and edge of the new blade was white-hot.  It sang and shrieked as it flew through the night air. (at this point it is supposed that the location of the river is not in England, but Africa. What would later be Lake Victoria, Victoria Falls and a branch of the Nile. The pieces of Calleberne were found by Merlin on a quest of his own, only tangentially related to anything Arthurian.  He retrieved the pieces from the deserts of Arabia, and borrowed a kiln from an Alchemist in the area to re-forge the pieces into what would become Excalibur. Again: Forged by Merlin; perfected and blessed by nature...Then left to be claimed by Arthur, if he was noble enough.)  To retrieve the new sword Arthur would have to make peace with nature and pray to the water sprites that guarded that part of the world.   Then the Lady of the Lake would reveal its location at a bend of the river in a shallow pool, where it had been deposited within the night of it's re-forging.  All that had to happen was for the Queen of Water Nymphs to remove the fog from the King's eyes. He had been fighting in a Crusade and perhaps looking for the Holy Grail. Generally, just lost.  Merlin hoped to give him the path to settle his spirit and the tools to get back to being a decent human again.&#xD;&#xA;=&#xD;&#xA;How I remember bits and pieces of the story that connect the legends of two swords.  One sword that became two and then was made into yet another.More importantly, the connections and emotions that intertwine the lives of men and women with each other and the world around them are explored in a hopeful, romantic, and mystical tale. Like all myths  and legend; they are bent and adapted to the culture to tell the story according to how the Minstrel doing the singing wants to see the story unfold.Of course there is an agenda.

The  CALLEBURNE was a the lightning-struck sword in the stone.  Until it had been hit by lightning and basically re-forged by the intense heat and electrical current, it was a cheap, plain iron sword.  The moss, rust, and scale had built up on it for years and the bolt from the blue added in some new minerals from the moldstone and coke/charcoal from the lichens growing there: re-making it to fine steel.  Some even say that it was one Merlin's early attempt at sword smithing and that he had abandoned the mold as the sprue of steel had run throughout his mold.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Something like this:&quot;Mother nature split the rock from way on high and broke away the Sword from the sprues and the lichen, slime, rust, other bits of dead corruption, and the living vines that had over-grown the mold that had become a Stone (in appearance anyway.) The pelting rain that follows the fireworks quenched the nearly molten steel. And perhaps the celestial arch even rendered lodestone (magnetized) of the blade in the process. As the Ore around the now-separated blade remained energized for hours after the jolt, the Field of current at the precipice of that hill would align every sliver of iron as it cooled with the very energy of all the metals deeply within the earth...  What had been Merlin's last failure as a Blacksmith and a beginning Alchemist had been corrected by the powers of the earth itself.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It is apparent to all that knew; Merlin had never actually been wrong, merely a sign of the impatience of his long-forgotten youth... as he could have certainly re-forged the weapon after that first casting went side-wrong.  He simple moved on to his next pyromancing adventure and experiments with new and better alloys of metal.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;As I remember reading it...  It had to be over 30-35 years ago.  It seems to me that it was a collection of Irish Folk tales. Though it may as well have been more generically Gaelic tales that were a combination Welsh, Scottish, Norwegian, Belgian, Bretton, or Burgandy French. It was definitely translated/adapted from a non-english European language tale about the British Isles and a Wizard/Druid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It was told from the POV of one of Merlin's relatives or at least a Druidic practical follower of the old ways of magic and enlightenment.  +I'll continue.This great sword was stolen from the corrupt regime of Arthur as he grew lax in the enforcement of his codes.  It was sold and cut into two separate swords by an opportunistic blacksmith that could make two fantastic single-sided blades from the double-edged Great Sword wonder.  These monstrosities were returned to Merlin, who re-forged them again back to a whole blade as one of his last acts for King Arthur.  To quench the sword, Merlin flung it into the edge of a lake that was drained by a powerful river; while the tip and edge of the new blade was white-hot.  It sang and shrieked as it flew through the night air. (at this point it is supposed that the location of the river is not in England, but Africa. What would later be Lake Victoria, Victoria Falls and a branch of the Nile. The pieces of Calleberne were found by Merlin on a quest of his own, only tangentially related to anything Arthurian.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;He retrieved the pieces from the deserts of Arabia, and borrowed a kiln from an Alchemist in the area to re-forge the pieces into what would become Excalibur. Again: Forged by Merlin; perfected and blessed by nature...Then left to be claimed by Arthur, if he was noble enough.)  To retrieve the new sword Arthur would have to make peace with nature and pray to the water sprites that guarded that part of the world.   Then the Lady of the Lake would reveal its location at a bend of the river in a shallow pool, where it had been deposited within the night of it's re-forging.  All that had to happen was for the Queen of Water Nymphs to remove the fog from the King's eyes. He had been fighting in a Crusade and perhaps looking for the Holy Grail. Generally, just lost.  Merlin hoped to give him the path to settle his spirit and the tools to get back to being a decent human again.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;How I remember bits and pieces of the story that connect the legends of two swords.  One sword that became two and then was made into yet another.More importantly, the connections and emotions that intertwine the lives of men and women with each other and the world around them are explored in a hopeful, romantic, and mystical tale. Like all myths  and legend; they are bent and adapted to the culture to tell the story according to how the Minstrel doing the singing wants to see the story unfold.Of course there is an agenda. Or two." />

If you want to learn more about vampires, the best way is to get a book from [your local library][1], and then ask question here if you are confused about anything the book says. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you want to write a book about vampires, I would just use your imagination, and not worry about about whether your story corresponds to mythology.

Whether vampires use code names is only a small piece of information you need to know about vampires: you also need to know more about what vampires look like, their personality, etc. The best place to learn about all of that would be a book from your local library.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Just my two cents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.worldcat.org/libraries" />

If the offerer is with a thankful heart, he will do it with a joy and it won't be a chore to him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;And sin offering via animal sacrifices (Lev 4): the sacrificer puts his hands on the animal, and kills the animal by himself. It signifies that even though he should be dead because of his sin, but the animal is killed on behalf of him and his sin. He repents while doing so and it's accepted. If not, it's not an offering but a slaughter.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;These knowledge are expressed throughout the whole Bible.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also, the New Testament mentions Abel. Heb 11:4 says, 'By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice.'&#xD;&#xA;And there are all kinds of faith in the same chapter: faith on God's very existence, his goodness, his joy, his love, his righteousness, his faithfulness, his vision, and his power.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It may look fuzzy, but it's really about having a personal relationship with God. God is not an object. If you have a healthy relationship with Father or Mother, how you are going to express your thankfulness to them? How about when you feel sorry? How about to your Husband or Wife? With God, you are having a relationship with the original one. God is our original as he created man in his image.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I recently became a father by myself and I thank God for the blessing. I could understand this matter better. Amen." />

Morgain le Fay dwelleth in mine house, and through knowledge of clerkly craft hath she taken many. For long time was she the mistress of Merlin, who knew well all you knights of the court. Morgain the goddess is she called therefore, and there is none so haughty but she can bring him low. She sent me in this guise to yon fair hall to test the truth of the renown that is spread abroad of the valour of the Round Table. She taught me this marvel to betray your wits, to vex Guinevere and fright her to death by the man who spake with his head in his hand at the high table. That is she who is at home, that ancient lady, she is even thine aunt, Arthur's half-sister, the daughter of the Duchess of Tintagel, who afterward married King Uther. Therefore I bid thee, knight, come to thine aunt, and make merry in thine house; my folk love thee, and I wish thee as well as any man on earth, by my faith, for thy true dealing.&quot;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This seems to be quite a cordial attitude, considering that the two have been acting as foes for the entire tale up until this point. I initially read Tolkien's translation, and interpreted it as saying that Morgain bewitched Bernlak (also called Bertilak) and kept him under a spell. However, it Bernlak's actions here suggest that he is no longer under such a spell, as he voluntarily gives away the information. At the same time, it seems odd that he would willingly carry out Morgain's wishes, as he seems to bear no enmity towards Guinevere or Arthur, nor could easily profit.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Was the Green Knight willing to fight Gawain, or was he forced to under a spell?" />

Not everything is useful but there's definitely enough to make it worth the low cost and having your own copy means you can notate it. &#xA;&#xA;As far European vampires go, there are a ton of variations in &quot;vampire species&quot; (Upir, Upyr, Upor, Obour, Ubour, Murony, Moroi, Nachzehrer) those are just a few examples. &#xA;&#xA;They vary wildly in abilities, how they feed, what they eat and many have some pretty weird traits. Like having only one nostril. Not sure why but there are several like that. There are also like 20 species that are just just floating heads with their spines dangling.&#xA;&#xA;I'd advise you to get the book. It's an interesting read if nothing else. Personally though I think you need to just commit if you go the vampire route. They're so engrained in our minds that if they act like a vampire that's how the audience is going to think of them no matter what they go by. &#xA;&#xA;If you decide not to do the vampire route the book still has a lot you might be able to use. You could take some of the traits from this and that and make your own creature. &#xA;&#xA;I'll leave the link here. If you think of anything specific you'd like me to look up feel free to ask. Otherwise good luck. &#xA;&#xA;http://www.amazon.com/Element-Encyclopedia-Vampires--z-Undead/dp/1435123409/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1448507773&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=element+encyclopedia+of+vampires" />

This list is by no means exhaustive: its purpose is merely to introduce the reader to a variety of sources about mythology. *Please do not be frightened by the amount of sources listed below: just choose a book or website that looks interesting and read it.* These books and websites are all interesting, so don't worry about choosing the &quot;wrong&quot; one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note to the reader: online sources have an *online* marker next to them.

Evelyn-White's hypothesis is that the authors of the non Homeric poems were reasonably aware of Homer's works. This is summarized in the introduction of *Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica*: &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; **The Trojan Cycle**&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Six epics with the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot; made up the Trojan Cycle—The &quot;Cyprian Lays&quot;, the &quot;Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Aethiopis&quot;, the &quot;Little Iliad&quot;, the &quot;Sack of Troy&quot;, the &quot;Returns&quot;, the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and the &quot;Telegony&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; It has been assumed in the foregoing pages that the poems of the Trojan Cycle are later than the Homeric poems; but, as the opposite view has been held, the reasons for this assumption must now be given. 1) Tradition puts Homer and the Homeric poems proper back in the ages before chronological history began, and at the same time assigns the purely Cyclic poems to definite authors who are dated from the first Olympiad (776 B.C.) downwards. This tradition cannot be purely arbitrary. 2) The Cyclic poets (as we can see from the abstract of Proclus) were careful not to trespass upon ground already occupied by Homer. Thus, when we find that in the &quot;Returns&quot; all the prominent Greek heroes except Odysseus are accounted for, we are forced to believe that the author of this poem knew the &quot;Odyssey&quot; and judged it unnecessary to deal in full with that hero's adventures. In a word, the Cyclic poems are 'written round' the &quot;Iliad&quot; and the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. 3) The general structure of these epics is clearly imitative. As M.M. Croiset remark, the abusive Thersites in the &quot;Aethiopis&quot; is clearly copied from the Thersites of the &quot;Iliad&quot;; in the same poem Antilochus, slain by Memnon and avenged by Achilles, is obviously modelled on Patroclus. 4) The geographical knowledge of a poem like the &quot;Returns&quot; is far wider and more precise than that of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. 5) Moreover, in the Cyclic poems epic is clearly degenerating morally—if the expression may be used. The chief greatness of the &quot;Iliad&quot; is in the character of the heroes Achilles and Hector rather than in the actual events which take place: in the Cyclic writers facts rather than character are the objects of interest, and events are so packed together as to leave no space for any exhibition of the play of moral forces. All these reasons justify the view that the poems with which we now have to deal were later than the &quot;Iliad&quot; and &quot;Odyssey&quot;, and if we must recognize the possibility of some conventionality in the received dating, we may feel confident that it is at least approximately just.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Project Gutenberg EBook of Hesiod, The Homeric Hymns, and Homerica, by Homer and Hesiod](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/348/348-h/348-h.htm#link2H_4_0012)&lt;/sub&gt; &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I believe this remains the prevalent theory, although the matter is far from settled.

So she conceived and brought forth fierce offspring; first she bare Orthus the hound of Geryones, and then again she bare a second, a monster not to be overcome and that may not be described, Cerberus who eats raw flesh, the brazen-voiced hound of Hades, fifty-headed, relentless and strong. And again she bore a third, the evil-minded Hydra of Lerna, whom the goddess, white-armed Hera nourished, being angry beyond measure with the mighty Heracles. And her Heracles, the son of Zeus, of the house of Amphitryon, together with warlike Iolaus, destroyed with the unpitying sword through the plans of Athene the spoil-driver. She was the mother of Chimaera who breathed raging fire, a creature fearful, great, swift-footed and strong, who had three heads, one of a grim-eyed lion; in her hinderpart, a dragon; and in her middle, a goat, breathing forth a fearful blast of blazing fire. Her did Pegasus and noble Bellerophon slay; but Echidna was subject in love to Orthus and brought forth the deadly Sphinx which destroyed the Cadmeans, and the Nemean lion, which Hera, the good wife of Zeus, brought up and made to haunt the hills of Nemea, a plague to men. There he preyed upon the tribes of her own people and had power over Tretus of Nemea and Apesas: yet the strength of stout Heracles overcame him.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; &lt;sub&gt;Source: [The Theogony of Hesiod, translated by Hugh G.

The first thing that we must remember is that most or all the material which makes up the so-called 'Epic Cycle' existed earlier in oral form.  That is, before the Greeks were literate and the epics were written down, they existed in more fluid oral versions. Proficient rhapsodes knew and could manipulate the oral traditions.  By that I mean that they could 'stitch together' various components of the epic cycle as they or their audience wanted. Homer was aware of the pre-existing oral traditions;  the *Iliad* itself was an oral composition. The later authors knew the traditions, as well, since some orality survived to Plato's time at least. (The transition from orality to literacy, called proto-literacy, involves both systems of transmission coexisting side by side -- a period that lasted about 400 years for the Greeks.) Just as the rhapsodes enjoyed latitude in the oral performance of lays from the epic cycle, so too the first writers of the epics admitted many influences and innovations.  That is, tradition was never a dead hand forcing certain authorial decisions:  poets have always practiced great compositional freedom. Thanks be to Apollo!" />

Of the original poem only some five hundred lines survive. Considering that, and the way scribes could elaborate on their sources, we can not now be sure whether the sword in the stone featured in Robert’s own work or not. Whichever is the case, the work does predate the Vulgate Cycle and the other prose works important to this discussion.   &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;([Toohey, Kathleen, King Arthur's Swords][4])&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If anyone is interested, you can [read the Prose Merlin online][5].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I have not found any *historical* reference to anyone pulling out a sword from a stone. I think this makes sense, because I imagine that it would be hard to put a sword there in the first place. Sarcasm aside, if you find a historical reference to someone pulling a sword our of something, feel free to let me know in the comments.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;------&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The following is in response to some of the things said in the original question.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm really sorry, but it is not a &quot;theory&quot; that the story of the sword in the stone originated from [Arthurian legend][1]. This is a fact. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The google document (why didn't you just link to the wikipedia page that the google document is copied from?) is a copy of [the wikipedia page for the movie The Last Legion][2]. This movie is &quot;a 2007 Fantasy film&quot; that combines Arthurian legend with roman history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;2. You say that `&quot;Some say that it was based in Rome and Merlin first possessed the sword given and made for Caesar Augustus, who ruled in Rome in 27 BC until 14 AD. Passing down the sword to each generation eventually being thrown into a stone that only a true Caesar could pull out.&quot;` *That is only true in the movie The Last Legion*, which, as stated previously, is a work of fantasy. This is not actual history.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;3. The legend of the sword in the stone, minus the stuff about Caesar Augustus (which, as stated previously, is from the movie The Last Legion), is from [Arthurian legend][1].  T.H. White is the author of [a children's book][3], which is *also* based on Arthurian legend.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The legend of the sword and the stone is a component of Arthurian legend. Arthurian legend is a collection of old stories about King Arthur. A common feature in many of those stories is the mini-story of the &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot;, which features King Arthur pulling a sword out of a stone.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://d.lib.rochester.edu/camelot-project&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Legion&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Once_and_Future_King&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: https://www.academia.edu/11478175/King_Arthurs_Swords&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/publication/conlee-prose-merlin" />

Heracles was Melqart, though the Greeks called both &quot;Heracles&quot;, one &quot;Tyrian&quot; and the other &quot;Greek.&quot; (Herodotus, [2.43–45][2], Cicero, _De Natura Deorum_, [3.43][3])This was very common.[4]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Another process common especially during the Hellenistic era was something called &quot;Euhemerism,&quot; named after Euhemerus, a Greek philosopher who thought e.g. the gods were once kings and mighty men who subsequently were worshiped as gods.

From Chaos came forth Erebus and black Night; but of Night were born Aether and Day, whom she conceived and bare from union in love with Erebus.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Chaos is sometimes depicted as an entity rather than a deity of some sort - the thing that existed before the universe. If you ascribe personification to it, then it counts as the first being. However, if not, then the so-called primordial gods were first:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - Earth (Gaia)&#xD;&#xA; - Tartarus&#xD;&#xA; - Eros&#xD;&#xA; - Erebus&#xD;&#xA; - Night&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Aether and Day are also considered by most authors to be two other of the primordial gods, though not created directly from Chaos.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;---&#xD;&#xA;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; There are variations on the idea. For example, [Gaius Hyginus](http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae1.html), a Roman scholar of Greek mythology, wrote that Chaos was formed from Mist, treating Chaos more as a being and Mist as something similar to Hesiod's depiction of Chaos. Hyginus is also notable for treating Earth as the child of Day and Aether, making the four deities born of Chaos and Caligine (a related but not well described entity) be Night, Day, Erebus, and Aether." />

In this case you can trust the wikipedia page, because it extensively cites its sources.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In this case, I think that the Wikipedia author understates the degree of inaccuracy of Robert Graves' work. [One review of the book rips apart essentially every aspect of Grave's scholarship][1], and all of the reviews I have found that aren't extremely old (i.e. from the 1950s) all agree that Graves' work isn't useful as a scholarly account of Greek mythology.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; Are Graves' myths mythologically valid in these senses? What purposes could they be used for?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you are looking for an accurate depiction of Greek Mythology, I would stay as far away from Graves' book as possible. [There are plenty of other sources that depict Greek mythology accurately][2].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, there is value in Graves' work, but only if you treat it as a fictional account of Greek mythology. Most critics seem to agree that Graves' works are beautifully written; [one source claims][3] that &quot;some of the most beautiful poems of our time&quot; come from Graves' work. [Another source][3] describes Graves as having &quot;fashioned a modern  myth  out of ancient material.&quot; To me, it sounds like Graves' works have value as a fictional mythology (like Tolkien's Silmarillion), and not as an accurate portrayal of Greek myth.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Disclaimer: I haven't actually read anything written by Robert Graves.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/704652&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://mythology.stackexchange.com/a/1133/62&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1396557" />

Here are some resources for you to get started with.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;By far the easiest way to learn more about mythology is to go to [your local library][1] and borrow one of their books about mythology. Don't worry about selecting the &quot;right&quot; source; just select a book that looks interesting to you. Remember, you are a beginner, therefore you don't know anything about mythology, and therefore *any* book will teach you something new.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, we recognize that not everyone can or would like to browse a library, and therefore have created a list of both online and offline resources. This list is by no means exhaustive: its purpose is merely to introduce the reader to a variety of sources about mythology. *Please do not be frightened by the amount of sources listed below: just choose a book or website that looks interesting and read it.* These books and websites are all interesting, so don't worry about choosing the &quot;wrong&quot; one.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Note to the reader: online sources have an *online* marker next to them.

[To quote from Alan Dundes, a professor of Folklore and Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; My  sole  point  in  mentioning this disheartening  incident is to  suggest that for  many  members of the literate public, the  study  of folklore means precisely Campbell and his writings. Yet professional folklorists  have said very little about the huge corpus of Campbelliana.  I do not know if  any  of his many books were ever even reviewed in JAF.  Is this a case of &quot;silence gives assent&quot;?  Very likely more people were introduced  to the  subject  matter of folklore by  the writings  of  Campbell or the PBS television series of lectures by  him than by any  other source. And yet we folklorists have said little or nothing about him and his theories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dundes makes a number of criticisms of Joseph Campbell. One of these is of his assumption that myths are universal, which, as Dundes quickly proves, is not the case. To quote from Dundes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It has  long  been a  popular fantasy among  amateur students of  myth  that all peoples share the same stories. This is  clearly  an  example  of wishful thinking. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples of myths that Joseph Campbell claims to be universal but which are not are include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The flood myth, which is &quot;absent from sub-Saharan Africa&quot; (Dundes).&#xD;&#xA;2. The &quot;virgin-birth&quot; motif, which is only present in three separate myths, and is absent from &quot;Africa... Siberia, Polynesia, ... Melanesia, ... Australia and New  Guinea&quot; (Dundes).&#xD;&#xA;3. The &quot;belly of the whale&quot; motif: this &quot;motif&quot; is only present in the old testament (Dundes). The only other example Campbell cites of a &quot;belly of the wale&quot; motif -- the story of Red Riding Hood -- is a horrible example. Red Riding Hood is only swallowed by a wolf in the written version of the story; in the oral version of the story &quot;the  girl  is not swallowed by  the wolf at all... Instead she  escapes through  a clever ruse  by pretending to need to go  outside to defecate&quot; (Dundes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it would be safe to say that Joseph Campbell's arguments that the monomyth is &quot;universal&quot; aren't very sound. If you are interested in reading more, [Dundes' article is available on JSTOR][1], which you can usually access for free from a [public library][2]. Dundes has other criticisms of of Campbell, but they aren't relevant to the question asked by the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also recently wrote a [blog post about Joseph Campbell that might interest you][3].&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/4137664&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.worldcat.org/libraries&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://medium.com/@taxicrash/joseph-campbell-is-a-fraud-966f67f99cba#.t6jxhoies" />

[To quote from Alan Dundes, a professor of Folklore and Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley][1]:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; My  sole  point  in  mentioning this disheartening  incident is to  suggest that for  many  members of the literate public, the  study  of folklore means precisely Campbell and his writings. Yet professional folklorists  have said very little about the huge corpus of Campbelliana.  I do not know if  any  of his many books were ever even reviewed in JAF.  Is this a case of &quot;silence gives assent&quot;?  Very likely more people were introduced  to the  subject  matter of folklore by  the writings  of  Campbell or the PBS television series of lectures by  him than by any  other source. And yet we folklorists have said little or nothing about him and his theories.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Dundes makes a number of criticisms of Joseph Campbell. One of these is of his assumption that myths are universal, which, as Dundes quickly proves, is not the case. To quote from Dundes:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;It has  long  been a  popular fantasy among  amateur students of  myth  that all peoples share the same stories. This is  clearly  an  example  of wishful thinking. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Examples of myths that Joseph Campbell claims to be universal but which are not are include:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;1. The flood myth, which is &quot;absent from sub-Saharan Africa&quot; (Dundes).&#xD;&#xA;2. The &quot;virgin-birth&quot; motif, which is only present in three separate myths, and is absent from &quot;Africa... Siberia, Polynesia, ... Melanesia, ... Australia and New  Guinea&quot; (Dundes).&#xD;&#xA;3. The &quot;belly of the whale&quot; motif: this &quot;motif&quot; is only present in the old testament (Dundes). The only other example Campbell cites of a &quot;belly of the wale&quot; motif -- the story of Red Riding Hood -- is a horrible example. Red Riding Hood is only swallowed by a wolf in the written version of the story; in the oral version of the story &quot;the  girl  is not swallowed by  the wolf at all... Instead she  escapes through  a clever ruse  by pretending to need to go  outside to defecate&quot; (Dundes).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think it would be safe to say that Joseph Campbell's arguments that the monomyth is &quot;universal&quot; aren't very sound. If you are interested in reading more, [Dundes' article is available on JSTOR][1], which you can usually access for free from a [public library][2]. Dundes has other criticisms of of Campbell, but they aren't relevant to the question asked by the OP.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also recently wrote a [blog post about Joseph Campbell that might interest you][3]. It elaborates on the points that I made in this post.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.jstor.org/stable/4137664&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://www.worldcat.org/libraries&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: https://medium.com/@taxicrash/the-monomyth-so-incorrect-it-s-dangerous-fffea85a9640#.ailnms8e8" />

We can also turn to the iconography, which likewise also does not necessarily portray a shield. See, e.g., the metope from Salinas ca. 540 B.C. (at the Museo Nazionale Archeologico in Palermo, Italy; in Morford &amp; Lenardon's *Classical Mythology* 8th ed., p. 552) and the black-figure jug by Amasis, Attic, 6th cen. BCE (in Neumann, *Consciousness* (below), illustration 25) both showing Perseus killing her while simply averting his gaze. For the Greeks, averting the gaze and looking at her reflection in the shield/mirror were obviously equivalent. Her power was either nullified or greatly diminished when looked at in reflection.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I also don't think the eyes were crucial. I'm not aware of any source that stresses her eyes. Rather, they focus on her whole face (Ovid, *Metamorphosis* 4:783) or overall appearance, as in the passage from Apollodoris that you quote. We can't ignore her protruding tongue, tusks, or snakes for hair, since they are all essential to her character and mythological meaning. That's why they are there. And that's why Perseus had to look at the shield even though she was sleeping (presumably her eyes were closed).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If we go into the underlying psychological aspects of the myth (as we should with most myths), Perseus, like the typical hero, is in the process of fully realizing his ego consciousness, while this monster represents the all-consuming Terrible Mother of the unconscious seeking to suck him back into there and destroy his nascent ego consciousness. To confront her directly is too dangerous, so only averting the gaze or looking at her indirectly through the reflection will enable him to succeed. In the versions where the &quot;bronze&quot; shield/mirror appears, that is a solar/light symbol of the ego that not only enables him to see a diminished Medusa, but which as such also serves as a guide and beacon to him to keep him on course. Here it is also relevant that the Greeks also stressed the details of his escape. When Perseus kills the Medusa, the winged horse Perseus appears out of her (representing the ego that has escaped her, a parallel with Perseus himself), which Perseus rides while being pursued by Medusa's sisters. His winged sandals, invisibility helmet, and hiding-wallet also play a figurative role, for which he has to thank Athena, goddess of wisdom (and so of consciousness). See Edward Edinger, *The Eternal Drama: The Inner Meaning of Greek Mythology,* pp. 4, 83; Erich Neumann, *The Great Mother,* p. 166; Erich Neumann, *The Origins and History of Consciousness,* pp. 87, 178, 214-16.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I hope this helps.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Humanity annoys the gods many times with its incessant noise. The gods, spearheaded by Enlil, cast several plagues on humanity; Enki (Ea) advises Atrahasis on how to help his people through each one. The last of these is the Deluge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[*The Epic of Ziusudra*](http://www.sacred-texts.com/ane/sum/sum09.htm), also partially lost, is a very similar version of the story. Again, Enki helps one ruler survive the flood brought on by the gods in an attempt to completely wipe out mankind. It does not appear that the two kings (Atrahasis and Ziusudra) are the same person, as both the names appear in different places on the [Sumerian King List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumerian_King_List)." />

A common tradition on New Year's Eve is to throw pomegranates on the ground, and break them apart. The more they burst, the more abundance your household will have.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Crete is basically Greece, and so the pomegranate is well known as a sign of abundance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[also:][2]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt;In Ancient Greek mythology, the pomegranate features prominently in the story of Persephone and her marriage to Hades, the god of the Underworld. Hades kidnapped Persephone and took her to the Underworld to be his wife. Persephone’s mother, Demeter, goddess of fertility, considering her daughter lost, went into mourning and thus all things on earth ceased to grow. Zeus, Persephone’s father, commanded his brother Hades to release her, however Hades had tricked her into eating six pomegranate seeds, and it was the rule of the Fates that anyone who consumed food or drink in the Underworld was doomed to spend eternity there. Since Persephone had eaten the six pomegranate seeds,  she had to remain in the Underworld for six months of the year. Hades agreed to release her to the world above for the other six months of the year, to be reunited with her mother. This is how the ancient Greeks explained the cycle of the seasons: when Persephone was with her mother, the earth flourished and the crops grew (Spring and Summer); when she returned to Hades, Demeter mourned and the earth was infertile (Autumn and Winter). As a consequence, pomegranates were often offered to the goddess Demeter in prayer for fertile land.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If you TLDRed it, then basically, the myth of Persephone and Hades ties in because offerings were brought to Demeter in the sign of a Pomegranate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://abc7.com/society/new-years-eve-traditions-around-the-world-said-to-bring-you-good-luck/455570/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://itsallgreeklondon.wordpress.com/2014/10/29/the-significance-of-the-pomegranate-in-ancient-greece/" />

Consider this representation of Alcyoneus, the king of the giants:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;[![The winged god Hypnos (Sleep personified) crouches in slumber on the chest of the giant Alkyoneus.

G. Frazer, vol. 6 1898.) Why exactly they were chosen to be represented this way is unknown, but it makes sense, considering that the giants are the offspring of Gaia (the earth), and serpents in Mediterranean religion (and elsewhere) are—for very obvious reasons—intimately connected with land and with Gaia herself. It was probably just to symbolically show their origins.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://www.theoi.com/image/L1.2Alkyoneus.jpg&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: Pausanias' *Description of Greece*, translated with a commentary by J.
